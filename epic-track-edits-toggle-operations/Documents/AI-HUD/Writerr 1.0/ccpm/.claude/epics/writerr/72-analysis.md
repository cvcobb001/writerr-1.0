# Issue #72 Analysis: Track Edits Plugin

## Parallel Work Streams

### Stream A: Core Change Detection Engine
**Agent Type:** code-analyzer  
**Can Start:** Immediately (builds on Task 71 types)  
**Dependencies:** Foundation types from Task 71  
**Files:**
- `packages/track-edits/src/engine/`
- `packages/track-edits/src/diff/`
- `packages/track-edits/src/detection/`

**Scope:**
- Advanced diff algorithms with word/phrase-level granularity
- Real-time change detection optimized for <100ms on 10K word docs
- Confidence scoring and change categorization system
- Performance benchmarks and optimization
- Custom diff engine optimized for Obsidian text analysis

### Stream B: Clustering & Batch Processing
**Agent Type:** general-purpose  
**Can Start:** After Stream A core types complete  
**Dependencies:** Stream A (Change detection types)  
**Files:**
- `packages/track-edits/src/clustering/`
- `packages/track-edits/src/batch/`
- `packages/track-edits/src/strategies/`

**Scope:**
- Intelligent clustering algorithms by category, confidence, proximity
- Dynamic cluster updates as changes are added
- Configurable batch processing with thresholds
- Batch submission and bulk operations
- Machine learning-inspired clustering strategies

### Stream C: Visual Interface Components
**Agent Type:** general-purpose  
**Can Start:** Immediately (can use mock data initially)  
**Dependencies:** None initially, Stream A for real data integration  
**Files:**
- `packages/track-edits/src/components/`
- `packages/track-edits/src/ui/`
- `packages/track-edits/src/animations/`

**Scope:**
- React components with smooth animations
- Inline diff rendering with strikethrough + highlights
- Change timeline and revision heatmap
- Granular accept/reject controls with keyboard shortcuts
- Responsive design and accessibility compliance

### Stream D: State Management & Persistence
**Agent Type:** general-purpose  
**Can Start:** After Stream A core types complete  
**Dependencies:** Stream A (Change types and detection)  
**Files:**
- `packages/track-edits/src/state/`
- `packages/track-edits/src/persistence/`
- `packages/track-edits/src/session/`

**Scope:**
- Per-document tracking state persistence
- Session-based change history with audit trail
- Crash recovery and state restoration
- Memory efficient storage for large documents
- Change compression for long-term storage

### Stream E: Integration & Performance
**Agent Type:** general-purpose  
**Can Start:** After Streams A, B, D have basic implementations  
**Dependencies:** Streams A, B, D  
**Files:**
- `packages/track-edits/src/integration/`
- `packages/track-edits/src/performance/`
- `packages/track-edits/src/api/`

**Scope:**
- API exposure for Writerr Chat and AI Editorial Functions
- Performance optimization for 100K+ word documents
- Virtual scrolling and lazy loading
- Background processing and memory management
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits

## Coordination Notes

- **Stream A** must complete core change detection types before Streams B and D
- **Stream C** can start immediately with mock data, integrate with Stream A later
- **Stream E** requires basic implementations from A, B, and D before starting
- **Testing** should be integrated throughout, especially for performance benchmarks

## Critical Dependencies

- Foundation Infrastructure (Task 71) completed âœ…
- Obsidian Editor APIs integration
- React 18 + Radix UI components
- Performance monitoring and benchmarking tools

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Handle 100K+ word documents without lag
- [ ] Change detection accuracy >99.5% 
- [ ] Visual updates render in <100ms
- [ ] Zero data loss during operations
- [ ] Memory usage <50MB for typical documents
- [ ] Complete API integration with other plugins
