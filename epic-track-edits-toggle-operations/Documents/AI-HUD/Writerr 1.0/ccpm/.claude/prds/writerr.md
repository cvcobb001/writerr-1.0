# PRD: Writerr

## Executive Summary

Writerr is a comprehensive AI editorial platform built as an Obsidian plugin suite comprising three sophisticated components:

1. **Track Edits** - Universal change management system with granular control, batching, clustering, and confidence thresholds
2. **Writerr Chat** - Conversational AI interface with dynamic mode system and customizable /Modes folder architecture  
3. **AI Editorial Functions** - Dynamic function registry that loads editorial behaviors from editable .md/.xml files with hot reloading

Unlike traditional AI writing tools that perform wholesale rewrites, Writerr provides a complete editorial ecosystem where every modification is visible, attributable, and individually reviewable. The system transforms AI writing assistance from a one-size-fits-all tool into a personalized editorial team that writers can customize and control.

**Target Timeline:** 30-day prototype development  
**Success Criteria:** Working prototype with all three core components integrated and functional

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?

Writers using AI assistance face five critical problems:
1. **Transparency Gap**: Most AI tools perform wholesale rewrites without showing what changed, making it impossible to understand or selectively accept modifications
2. **Loss of Creative Control**: AI suggestions often overwrite the writer's unique voice and style without giving granular choice over individual changes
3. **Configuration Chaos**: Every AI plugin manages its own settings, forcing writers to repeatedly configure API keys and model preferences across tools
4. **One-Size-Fits-All Limitation**: Generic AI assistants cannot adapt to specific writing contexts, genres, or editorial needs
5. **No Editorial Customization**: Writers cannot create specialized AI editors for different types of work or modify AI behavior without code changes

### Why is this important now?

As AI writing tools proliferate, professional and creative writers need systems that enhance rather than replace their creative process. The current "black box" approach to AI editing creates trust issues and workflow disruption that prevent writers from fully leveraging AI capabilities while maintaining their creative integrity. Writers need a customizable editorial platform that can adapt to their specific needs, genres, and workflows while providing complete transparency and control.

## User Stories
