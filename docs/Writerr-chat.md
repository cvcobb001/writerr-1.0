Writerr Chat: Conversational AI with Dynamic Programmatic Edit Modes

  Overview

  Writerr Chat is a conversational AI writing assistant built specifically for writers who want AI help without
  losing creative control. Unlike generic AI chat tools, Writerr Chat understands your documents, respects your
  writing process, and offers dynamic programmatic edit modes that let you collaborate with AI on your terms.

  The Interface

  Single Chat Interface with Mode Switching:
  - Familiar conversational chat interface for all interactions
  - Header dropdown (where it normally says "Chat") lets you switch between modes
  - Same natural conversation style regardless of mode
  - Different programmatic behaviors activate based on selected mode

  The Four Core Modes

  üí¨ Chat Mode (default)

  - Pure conversation - no document edits
  - Research, brainstorming, discussion, Q&A
  - Information stays in chat panel only
  - Default fallback if no custom prompts are loaded

  üìù Copy Edit Mode

  - AI analyzes text and suggests structural/style improvements
  - Makes copy editing-level suggestions that flow to Track Edits
  - Focus on clarity, flow, consistency, readability

  üîç Proofread Mode

  - AI scans for mechanical errors
  - Suggests corrections for typos, grammar, punctuation
  - Minimal, precise edits sent to Track Edits

  ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Assistant Mode

  - AI actively collaborates on content creation
  - Suggests rewrites, alternative phrasing, content expansion
  - More substantial creative input flowing to Track Edits

  Dynamic Mode System

  üìÅ Completely Customizable via /Modes Folder:

  Modes/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chat.md                    # Default conversational mode
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ copy-edit.md              # Structural/style improvements
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ proofread.md              # Grammar/mechanics corrections
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ writing-assistant.md      # Creative collaboration
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ development-editor.md     # User-added: technical accuracy
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ brand-voice-editor.md     # User-added: company voice/tone
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ academic-reviewer.md      # User-added: citations, formal structure
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ seo-editor.md             # User-added: search optimization
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ character-voice-coach.md  # User-added: dialogue consistency

  üîÑ How It Works:
  1. Dynamic Loading: Chat scans /Modes folder on startup
  2. Auto-Population: Each .md file becomes a selectable mode in the dropdown
  3. Custom Prompts: Each file contains highly specific instructions for that editing approach
  4. Unlimited Expansion: Users can create modes for any writing scenario

  Writer-Centric Design Philosophy

  Document Intelligence:
  - Context-aware of current document, selections, and entire vault
  - Maintains context across long writing sessions
  - References specific sections, characters, themes, or research
  - Multi-document awareness for project-wide assistance

  Writer-Friendly Interface:
  - Large, multi-line composition areas designed for real writing
  - Enter for newlines, Cmd+Enter to send - built for writing workflows
  - Gray secondary elements with clear visual hierarchy
  - 120px minimum text areas for comfortable multi-line composition

  Granular Control Integration:
  - Never overwrites text directly
  - All edit suggestions flow through Track Edits for granular acceptance/rejection
  - Maintains clear attribution between your words and AI assistance
  - Designed to enhance your voice, not replace it
