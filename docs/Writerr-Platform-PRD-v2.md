## Core Components

### 1. Editorial Engine Plugin (Core)

#### Primary Function
Neutral constraint processing system that compiles natural language editing preferences into executable rulesets and routes processing to appropriate engines.

#### Key Features
- **Natural Language Compilation**: Transform writing preferences into programmatic constraints
- **Mode Registry**: User-defined editing modes (Proofreader, Copy Editor, Developmental Editor)
- **Constraint Enforcement**: Multi-layer validation preventing AI drift and role violations
- **Engine Routing**: Pluggable adapter system for different processing engines
- **Provenance Tracking**: Complete audit trail from input to output

#### Core Pipeline
```
Intake → Normalize → Validate → Compile → Route → Execute → Assemble
```

#### Data Flow
```typescript
IntakePayload → Intent → ExecutionPlan → EngineResult[] → JobResult
```

### 2. Writerr Chat Plugin (Interface)

#### Primary Function
Conversational AI interface that transforms natural language user input into structured Editorial Engine requests.

#### Key Features
- **Contextual Conversations**: Document and vault-aware AI interactions
- **Mode-Based Processing**: Users select editing modes that govern AI behavior
- **Structured Handoffs**: Convert chat messages into Editorial Engine IntakePayloads
- **Result Integration**: Display processed results with change attribution
- **Session Management**: Maintain conversation context and processing history

#### Integration Points
- **To Editorial Engine**: Submit structured processing requests
- **From Track Edits**: Display change results within conversation flow
- **AI Providers**: Route all AI requests through centralized configuration

### 3. Track Edits Plugin (Foundation)

#### Primary Function
Universal change management system that provides visual tracking and granular control over all document modifications.

#### Key Features
- **Universal Change Pipeline**: All text modifications flow through Track Edits
- **Visual Diff Engine**: Real-time highlighting of additions, deletions, modifications
- **Intelligent Clustering**: Group related changes for efficient batch processing
- **Change Attribution**: Tag every modification with source and confidence
- **Session Persistence**: Maintain edit history across document switches and app restarts

#### Integration Points
- **From Editorial Engine**: Receive processed changes via adapter
- **To User**: Provide accept/reject interface for all modifications
- **Cross-Plugin**: Accept changes from any Obsidian plugin via API

## User Experience Design

### Installation & Onboarding
1. **Single Install Flow**: "Install Writerr Platform" installs all three plugins
2. **Unified Setup Wizard**: Configure AI providers, editing preferences, visual themes
3. **Default Modes**: Pre-configured editing modes (Proofreader, Copy Editor, etc.)
4. **Quick Start Guide**: Interactive tutorial demonstrating platform capabilities

### Daily Workflow
1. **Open Writerr Chat**: Access via ribbon, command palette, or hotkey
2. **Select Editing Mode**: Choose appropriate mode for task (Proofreader, Copy Editor, etc.)
3. **Natural Language Request**: "Please proofread this paragraph for grammar errors"
4. **Automated Processing**: Editorial Engine compiles request and executes constraints
5. **Review Changes**: Track Edits displays modifications with accept/reject controls
6. **Iterative Refinement**: Continue conversation to refine or modify results

### Advanced Usage
- **Custom Mode Creation**: Define editing behaviors in natural language
- **Batch Processing**: Apply modes to multiple documents or sections
- **Team Collaboration**: Share custom modes across team members
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Monitor editing patterns and AI effectiveness

## Technical Specifications

### Editorial Engine Core

#### Mode Definition Format
```typescript
interface ModeDefinition {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  naturalLanguageRules: {
    allowed: string[];      // "Fix spelling and grammar errors"
    forbidden: string[];    // "Never change the author's voice"  
    focus: string[];        // "Focus on clarity and flow"
    boundaries: string[];   // "Change no more than 15% of words"
  };
  examples?: Array<{
    input: string;
    expectedBehavior: string;
    shouldNotDo: string;
  }>;
}
```

#### Compilation Pipeline
```typescript
class RulesetCompiler {
  async compileMode(mode: ModeDefinition): Promise<ExecutionRuleset> {
    const intents = await this.parseNaturalLanguage(mode);
    const constraints = await this.mapToConstraints(intents);
    const validationRules = await this.generateValidationRules(intents, constraints);
    const executionParams = await this.deriveExecutionParams(intents);
    
    return { constraints, validationRules, executionParams };
  }
}
```

### Platform Communication

#### Event Bus Architecture
```typescript
interface WritterrEventBus {
  // Cross-plugin coordination
  emit('chat.request-processing', { intake: IntakePayload });
  emit('editorial.processing-complete', { result: JobResult });  
  emit('track-edits.changes-applied', { changes: Change[] });
  
  // User interaction events
  on('mode-changed', (mode: string) => void);
  on('document-switched', (file: TFile) => void);
  on('settings-updated', (settings: WritterrSettings) => void);
}
```

#### Shared Type System
```typescript
// Platform-wide data contracts
export interface IntakePayload {
  instructions: string;
  sourceText: string;
  context: ProcessingContext;
  preferences: UserPreferences;
  sessionId: string;
}

export interface JobResult {
  success: boolean;
  changes: Change[];
  conflicts: ChangeConflict[];
  provenance: ProvenanceChain;
  summary: ExecutionSummary;
}
```

### Integration APIs

#### Editorial Engine API
```typescript
interface EditorialEngineAPI {
  process(intake: IntakePayload): Promise<JobResult>;
  registerMode(mode: ModeDefinition): Promise<void>;
  getModes(): ModeDefinition[];
  registerAdapter(adapter: EngineAdapter): void;
}
```

#### Track Edits Adapter
```typescript
class TrackEditsAdapter implements EngineAdapter {
  name = 'track-edits';
  supportedOperations = ['edit', 'annotate'];
  
  async execute(job: ExecutionJob): Promise<EngineResult> {
    const trackEditsFormat = this.convertToTrackEditsFormat(job.payload);
    const result = await window.TrackEdits.submitChanges(trackEditsFormat);
    return this.convertFromTrackEditsFormat(result);
  }
}
```

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

#### High: Complex Constraint Compilation
**Risk**: Natural language → programmatic rules is inherently difficult
**Mitigation**: Start with template-based compilation, iterate based on user feedback

#### Medium: Plugin Coordination Complexity  
**Risk**: Three-plugin coordination could introduce bugs and instability
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive integration testing, careful event bus design

#### Medium: Performance with Large Documents
**Risk**: Constraint processing could become slow with complex documents
**Mitigation**: Implement lazy evaluation, background processing, progressive enhancement

### Product Risks

#### High: User Learning Curve
**Risk**: Platform complexity could overwhelm non-technical users
**Mitigation**: Extensive onboarding, pre-built modes, progressive disclosure

#### Medium: AI Model Dependency
**Risk**: Platform depends on quality AI model access
**Mitigation**: Support multiple AI providers, graceful degradation

#### Low: Competition from Integrated Tools
**Risk**: AI writing tools with built-in editors could compete
**Mitigation**: Focus on Obsidian ecosystem advantages, professional features
