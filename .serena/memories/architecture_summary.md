### Key Architectural Principles

#### 1. Universal Change Pipeline
All text modifications flow through Track Edits regardless of source:
- Manual user edits
- AI suggestions from Writerr Chat
- Outputs from AI Editorial Functions
- Changes from other compatible plugins

#### 2. Dual-Layer Architecture
- **Foundation Layer**: Track Edits provides core change tracking
- **Feature Layer**: Chat and Editorial Functions provide specialized capabilities
- **Integration Layer**: Shared APIs and event systems for communication

#### 3. Bulletproof Operation Requirements
Focus on reliability and robustness:
- **Toggle-Off Clean Shutdown**: Complete cleanup of outstanding edits
- **Session Persistence**: Edit history preserved across restarts and file switches
- **Memory Management**: Prevention of memory leaks and resource accumulation
