# Stream B: Plugin Registry System

## Scope
Dynamic plugin capability registration, service discovery and dependency resolution, version compatibility checking, plugin lifecycle management, API exposure management.

## Files
- packages/shared/src/registry/
- packages/shared/src/discovery/

## Progress
- ✅ Plugin capability registration system implemented
- ✅ Service discovery and dependency resolution completed
- ✅ Version compatibility checking system created
- ✅ Plugin lifecycle management (load, unload, enable, disable) implemented
- ✅ API exposure management for cross-plugin communication completed
- ✅ Utility functions and factory patterns added

## Implementation Details

### Core Components Completed:
1. **PluginRegistry** - Main registry for plugin lifecycle management
2. **VersionChecker** - Semantic version compatibility checking
3. **ServiceDiscovery** - API discovery and cross-plugin communication
4. **DependencyResolver** - Dependency resolution and load ordering
5. **PluginManager** - Orchestrator combining all systems
6. **PluginUtils** - Utility functions for common operations
7. **PluginFactory** - Factory patterns for standard plugin creation

### Key Features:
- Dynamic plugin capability registration
- Automatic dependency resolution and load ordering
- Version compatibility checking with semantic versioning
- Complete plugin lifecycle management (load/unload/enable/disable)
- Service discovery with API method and event management
- Comprehensive error handling and event emission
- Performance monitoring for API calls
- Circular dependency detection
- Conflict resolution for version requirements

### Files Created:
- `packages/shared/src/registry/types.ts` - Core type definitions
- `packages/shared/src/registry/PluginRegistry.ts` - Plugin registry implementation
- `packages/shared/src/registry/VersionChecker.ts` - Version compatibility system
- `packages/shared/src/registry/PluginManager.ts` - Main orchestrator
- `packages/shared/src/registry/PluginUtils.ts` - Utility functions
- `packages/shared/src/registry/PluginFactory.ts` - Factory patterns
- `packages/shared/src/discovery/ServiceDiscovery.ts` - Service discovery system
- `packages/shared/src/discovery/DependencyResolver.ts` - Dependency resolution
- Both index files with comprehensive exports

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

All deliverables for Stream B have been implemented and committed. The plugin registry system is fully functional and ready for integration with other streams.
