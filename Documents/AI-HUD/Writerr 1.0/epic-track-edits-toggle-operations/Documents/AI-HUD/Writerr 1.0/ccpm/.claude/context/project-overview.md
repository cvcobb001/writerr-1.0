# Project Overview

## Core Features

### 1. PRD Management System
- **Guided Creation**: Interactive brainstorming process for comprehensive requirements
- **Template Structure**: User stories, success criteria, constraints, and assumptions
- **Version Control**: Track changes and evolution of requirements over time
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor implementation progress across multiple epics
- **Commands**: `/pm:prd-new`, `/pm:prd-edit`, `/pm:prd-list`, `/pm:prd-status`

### 2. Epic Planning & Decomposition
- **Technical Translation**: Transform business requirements into implementation plans
- **Architectural Decisions**: Document technical approaches and rationale
- **Task Breakdown**: Decompose features into concrete, actionable work items
- **Dependency Mapping**: Identify and sequence interdependent tasks
- **Parallel Identification**: Flag tasks that can be executed simultaneously
- **Commands**: `/pm:prd-parse`, `/pm:epic-decompose`, `/pm:epic-show`, `/pm:epic-list`

### 3. GitHub Integration Layer
- **Issue Creation**: Push epics and tasks to GitHub as structured issues
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Maintain epic-task hierarchy using gh-sub-issue
- **Label Management**: Automatic labeling for organization and filtering
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Keep local and GitHub state synchronized
- **Team Visibility**: All work visible to human team members
- **Commands**: `/pm:epic-sync`, `/pm:epic-oneshot`, `/pm:issue-sync`, `/pm:sync`

### 4. Parallel Execution Engine
- **Agent Specialization**: Different agents for UI, API, database, and testing work
- **Context Isolation**: Each agent maintains focused context for their domain
- **Coordination Protocol**: Git commits and issue updates provide synchronization
- **Resource Management**: Prevent conflicts through git worktrees
- **Progress Aggregation**: Combine individual agent progress into unified updates
- **Commands**: `/pm:issue-start`, `/pm:issue-status`, `/pm:next`

### 5. Workflow Management
- **Status Dashboard**: Overall project health and progress visualization
- **Priority Intelligence**: Automatic next-task recommendations
- **Standup Reports**: Daily progress summaries for team coordination
- **Blocking Issue Detection**: Identify and surface impediments
- **Work-in-Progress Tracking**: Monitor concurrent development streams
- **Commands**: `/pm:status`, `/pm:standup`, `/pm:next`, `/pm:blocked`, `/pm:in-progress`

## Current Implementation State
