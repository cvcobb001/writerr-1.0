# Issue #4 Analysis: Writerr Chat Plugin

## Parallel Work Streams

### Stream A: Mode System & Hot Reload Engine
**Agent Type:** general-purpose  
**Can Start:** Immediately  
**Dependencies:** Foundation infrastructure (completed)  
**Files:**
- `packages/writerr-chat/src/modes/`
- `packages/writerr-chat/src/loader/`
- `packages/writerr-chat/src/parser/`

**Scope:**
- Dynamic discovery of .md files in /Modes folder
- Hot-reloading system without breaking active sessions
- Mode definition parser with comprehensive validation
- Mode registry and lifecycle management
- Template system for custom mode creation

### Stream B: Core Chat Interface
**Agent Type:** general-purpose  
**Can Start:** Immediately (can use mock modes initially)  
**Dependencies:** None initially, Stream A for real mode integration  
**Files:**
- `packages/writerr-chat/src/components/`
- `packages/writerr-chat/src/ui/`
- `packages/writerr-chat/src/interface/`

**Scope:**
- Single chat interface with dropdown mode selection
- Large text areas (120px+) with proper keyboard handling
- Writer-friendly interface design with clear visual hierarchy
- Session continuity across mode switches
- Responsive design and accessibility

### Stream C: Document Intelligence & Context
**Agent Type:** code-analyzer  
**Can Start:** Immediately  
**Dependencies:** Foundation types  
**Files:**
- `packages/writerr-chat/src/context/`
- `packages/writerr-chat/src/intelligence/`
- `packages/writerr-chat/src/vault/`

**Scope:**
- Document context awareness with selection understanding
- Multi-document project context and relationship mapping
- Semantic analysis of document structure and themes
- Context extraction and caching for performance
- Vault-wide relationship tracking

### Stream D: Core Chat Modes Implementation
**Agent Type:** general-purpose  
**Can Start:** After Stream A basic mode system is ready  
**Dependencies:** Stream A (mode loading system)  
**Files:**
- `packages/writerr-chat/modes/`
- `packages/writerr-chat/src/builtin/`

**Scope:**
- Four core modes: Chat, Copy Edit, Proofread, Writing Assistant
- Mode-specific behavior and prompt engineering
- Default mode templates and examples
- Mode validation and error handling
- Mode switching logic and context preservation

### Stream E: Track Edits Integration & AI Providers
**Agent Type:** general-purpose  
**Can Start:** After Streams A, B have basic implementations  
**Dependencies:** Streams A, B (chat interface and mode system)  
**Files:**
- `packages/writerr-chat/src/integration/`
- `packages/writerr-chat/src/providers/`

**Scope:**
- Seamless integration with Track Edits for all edit suggestions
- AI Providers plugin SDK integration
- Response routing to Track Edits change system
- Error handling and fallback strategies
- Performance optimization for AI calls

## Coordination Notes

- **Stream A** must complete basic mode loading before Stream D can implement core modes
- **Stream B** can start immediately with mock data, integrate with Stream A later
- **Stream C** can work independently on document intelligence
- **Stream E** requires basic implementations from A and B before starting
- **Testing** should be integrated throughout with real Obsidian environment

## Critical Dependencies

- Foundation Infrastructure (completed ✅)
- Track Edits Plugin (completed ✅) - for edit suggestions routing
- AI Providers Plugin SDK integration
- Obsidian Editor APIs for document context
- React 18 + Radix UI components
