[Changes appear automatically in Track Edits timeline]

```

- Line 67: Missing Oxford comma in series

Consistency Notes:
- Mix of "email" vs "e-mail" throughout
- Date format inconsistency

Overall: High quality writing with minor polish needed
```

Strategic feedback on content, structure, and flow. Helps develop ideas and improve overall writing effectiveness.

```
AI: Your introduction has solid information but needs more engagement:

Structure Suggestions:

- Add a bridge sentence connecting hook to main argument

Would you like me to draft a revised version?

3. Polish individual paragraphs (Copy Edit mode)
4. Final review for errors (Proofread mode)
```

**Maintain Context**:

- Explain document purpose: "This is the introduction to..."
- Specify constraints: "Keep it under 200 words"

### Custom Mode Strategy

**Personal Writing Coach**:

- Include your specific writing goals
- Reference your typical weaknesses
- Adapt tone to your preferences
- Include domain-specific knowledge
```

**Team Collaboration**:
```markdown
- Create shared modes for team projects
- Include brand voice guidelines

- Maintain consistency across writers
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Mode not appearing in selector**:
- ‚úÖ Check `.md` file is in `/Modes/` folder
- ‚úÖ Verify YAML frontmatter syntax
- ‚úÖ Ensure required fields (name, description) are present
- ‚úÖ Look for error notifications

**AI not responding**:
- Check AI Providers plugin configuration
