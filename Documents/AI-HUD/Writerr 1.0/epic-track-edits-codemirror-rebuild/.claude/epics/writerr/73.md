# Task 003: Writerr Chat Plugin

## Overview
Build the sophisticated conversational AI interface with dynamic mode switching, unlimited customization through /Modes folder architecture, and deep document intelligence. This is the primary user interaction point for AI assistance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Single chat interface with dropdown mode selection
- [ ] Four core modes implemented: Chat, Copy Edit, Proofread, Writing Assistant
- [ ] Dynamic mode loading from /Modes folder with hot-reload
- [ ] Mode definition parser for .md files with comprehensive validation
- [ ] Document context awareness with selection understanding
- [ ] Multi-document project context and relationship mapping
- [ ] Large text areas (120px+) with proper keyboard handling
- [ ] Writer-friendly interface design with clear visual hierarchy
- [ ] Seamless integration with Track Edits for all edit suggestions
- [ ] Session continuity across mode switches
- [ ] Template system for custom mode creation
- [ ] Comprehensive mode validation and error recovery

## Technical Requirements

### Mode System Architecture
- Dynamic discovery of .md files in /Modes folder
- Hot-reloading without breaking active sessions
- Mode definition validation with user-friendly error messages
- Mode switching with context preservation
- Template generation for new modes

### Core Mode Implementation
- **Chat Mode**: Pure conversation with no document edits
- **Copy Edit Mode**: Structural/style improvements routed to Track Edits
- **Proofread Mode**: Grammar/mechanics corrections with minimal changes
- **Writing Assistant Mode**: Creative collaboration with substantial input

### Document Intelligence
- Advanced context extraction from current document
- Selection awareness and context understanding
- Vault-wide relationship mapping
- Multi-document project awareness
- Semantic analysis of document structure
- Context caching for performance

### User Interface
- Large, comfortable text composition areas
- Intuitive mode switching dropdown
- Clear visual feedback for mode changes
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- Professional writer-focused design aesthetic

### Mode Definition System
- Markdown-based mode definitions with YAML frontmatter
- Comprehensive prompt and constraint specification
- Track Edits integration configuration per mode
- Validation rules and error handling
- Version control and mode evolution support

## Dependencies
- Foundation Infrastructure (Task 001)
- Track Edits Plugin (Task 002)
- AI Providers Plugin (existing)
- React 18 + TypeScript
- File system APIs for mode loading

## Integration Points
- All edit modes route suggestions through Track Edits
- AI calls go through AI Providers plugin
- Document context shared with other Writerr components

## Estimated Effort
**87 hours (11 days)**

## Risks
- Hot-reload reliability for mode definitions
- Complex document context analysis
- Mode definition parsing edge cases
- Performance with many custom modes
- User-created mode quality and validation

## Success Metrics
- Mode switching completes in <500ms
- Hot-reload success rate >95%
- Support 100+ custom modes without performance degradation
- User can create functional custom mode within 15 minutes
- Document context analysis completes in <300ms
- Zero chat sessions lost during mode switches
