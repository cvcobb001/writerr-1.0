- Event factory, validator, and type-safe payload definitions
- Standardized event metadata with priority and retry policies

✅ **Implemented CrossPluginBridge for track-edits**
- File: `packages/track-edits/src/communication/CrossPluginBridge.ts`
- Document change notifications, edit suggestion broadcasting
- Integration with AI providers for change analysis
- Performance monitoring and statistics

✅ **Implemented CrossPluginBridge for writerr-chat**
- File: `packages/writerr-chat/src/communication/CrossPluginBridge.ts`
- Chat message routing, mode change notifications
- Document context synchronization, event throttling
- AI request coordination and function invocation

✅ **Implemented CrossPluginBridge for ai-editorial-functions**
- File: `packages/ai-editorial-functions/src/communication/CrossPluginBridge.ts`
- Function execution broadcasting, quality feedback handling
- Auto-triggering based on document changes
- Batch processing and queue management

### 3. Core Infrastructure Features

✅ **Error Handling & Retry Logic Standardization**
- Consistent error handling patterns across all adapters
- Exponential backoff retry mechanisms
- Circuit breaker implementation for provider failure handling
- Comprehensive error event propagation

✅ **Rate Limit Management Across Plugins** 
- Per-provider rate limiting with configurable windows
- Request queuing and throttling mechanisms
- Rate limit coordination between plugins
- Intelligent request spacing and batching

✅ **Model Selection and Routing Intelligence**
- Content-aware model selection (length, urgency, type)
- Specialization matching for editorial functions
- Performance-based routing decisions
- Fallback chains with health monitoring

### 4. Testing Coverage
✅ **Comprehensive test suites created**
- AIProvidersAdapter tests: `packages/track-edits/src/integration/__tests__/AIProvidersAdapter.test.ts`
- CrossPluginEvents tests: `packages/shared/src/events/__tests__/CrossPluginEvents.test.ts`  
- CrossPluginBridge tests: `packages/writerr-chat/src/communication/__tests__/CrossPluginBridge.test.ts`
- Test coverage: Initialization, error handling, rate limiting, model selection, event validation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions
- **Singleton Pattern**: All adapters and bridges use singleton instances for consistent state
- **Event-Driven Communication**: All inter-plugin communication uses standardized events
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents cascade failures across AI providers
- **Factory Pattern**: Consistent event creation with validation

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Unified AI Model Access** - Single interface for all plugins to access AI providers
2. **Cross-Plugin Event Bus** - Typed, validated communication between all components  
3. **Intelligent Model Routing** - Content-aware selection of optimal AI models
4. **Circuit Breakers** - Automatic failure isolation and recovery
5. **Rate Limit Management** - Prevents API quota exhaustion across plugins
6. **Response Caching** - Reduces redundant AI requests with intelligent caching
7. **Performance Monitoring** - Real-time metrics and health tracking
8. **Quality Scoring** - AI response evaluation and feedback loops

### Integration Points
- **track-edits ↔ AI Providers**: Edit suggestions, change analysis
- **writerr-chat ↔ AI Providers**: Message processing, streaming responses  
- **ai-editorial-functions ↔ AI Providers**: Function execution, batch processing
- **All Plugins ↔ Event System**: Status updates, performance metrics, error reporting

### Total Lines of Code Added: ~7,000+ lines

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed JSDoc documentation
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper separation of concerns

### Testing
- Unit tests for critical functionality
- Integration test scenarios
- Mock implementations for external dependencies
- Error condition testing
- Performance and concurrency testing

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient caching strategies
- Request batching and queuing  
- Memory-conscious data structures
- Background cleanup processes
- Configurable performance thresholds

## Next Steps for Integration

1. **Integration Testing** - Test cross-plugin communication in real environment
2. **Performance Tuning** - Optimize based on real usage patterns
3. **Error Monitoring** - Set up logging and alerting for production
4. **Documentation Updates** - Update plugin documentation with new features
5. **Configuration Management** - Externalize configuration options

## Compatibility Notes

- All implementations maintain backward compatibility with existing plugin APIs
- Event system is designed to be extensible for future plugin additions
- Configuration options allow gradual feature rollout
- Graceful degradation when AI Providers plugin is unavailable
