# Stream B: Clustering & Batch Processing

## Scope
Intelligent clustering algorithms by category, confidence, proximity, dynamic cluster updates as changes are added, configurable batch processing with thresholds, batch submission and bulk operations, machine learning-inspired clustering strategies.

## Files
- packages/track-edits/src/clustering/
- packages/track-edits/src/batch/
- packages/track-edits/src/strategies/

## Progress
✅ **COMPLETED** - All stream requirements implemented

### Completed Features
1. **Clustering System** (`packages/track-edits/src/clustering/`)
   - `ClusteringEngine.ts` - Main clustering orchestrator with real-time updates
   - `types.ts` - Comprehensive clustering type definitions
   - Dynamic cluster updates as changes are added
   - Performance optimization with debounced updates
   - Comprehensive error handling and validation

2. **Machine Learning-Inspired Strategies** (`packages/track-edits/src/strategies/`)
   - `MLInspiredStrategy.ts` - K-means, DBSCAN, hierarchical, and spectral clustering
   - `CategoryStrategy.ts` - Category-based clustering with confidence sub-clustering
   - `ProximityStrategy.ts` - Position-based clustering with adaptive thresholds
   - Strategy auto-selection based on data characteristics
   - Configurable clustering parameters for each strategy

3. **Batch Processing System** (`packages/track-edits/src/batch/`)
   - `BatchProcessor.ts` - Configurable batch processing with thresholds
   - Bulk operations support (accept/reject/cluster operations)
   - Batch queue management with priority ordering
   - Progress tracking and error recovery
   - Automatic batch submission based on thresholds

4. **Integration Layer**
   - `ClusteringManager.ts` - Main interface coordinating clustering and batching
   - Intelligent processing combining clustering and batching
   - Auto-strategy selection based on change characteristics  
   - Comprehensive system status and metrics
   - Event-driven architecture with cluster update notifications

### Technical Highlights
- **ML Algorithms**: K-means with k-means++ initialization, DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering
- **Real-time Updates**: Debounced dynamic cluster updates for performance
- **Strategy Selection**: Automatic best-strategy selection based on data analysis
- **Batch Thresholds**: Configurable by count, confidence sum, time window, cluster count
- **Performance Optimization**: Memory management, complexity analysis, scalability metrics
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and recovery mechanisms
