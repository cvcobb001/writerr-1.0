# Writerr Security Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-08-21  
**Scope:** Complete security analysis of all three Writerr plugins  
**Status:** In Progress  

## Executive Summary

This security audit covers the three core plugins in the Writerr ecosystem:
- **AI Editorial Functions**: User-generated function execution and validation
- **Track Edits**: Data persistence and state management security  
- **Writerr Chat**: AI provider integration and mode parsing security

## Critical Security Concerns

### High Priority
1. **User-Generated Code Execution**: Functions in ai-editorial-functions execute user code
2. **AI API Key Handling**: Secure storage and transmission of API credentials
3. **Data Persistence Security**: Track Edits stores potentially sensitive user content
4. **Cross-Plugin Communication**: Event bus security and plugin isolation

### Medium Priority  
1. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization of all user inputs
2. **Mode Parsing**: Safe parsing of user-defined chat modes
3. **Error Information Leakage**: Preventing sensitive data in error messages

### Low Priority
1. **Performance-based Security**: DoS prevention through resource limits
2. **Logging Security**: Preventing sensitive data in logs

## Detailed Analysis by Plugin

### AI Editorial Functions Security

#### Current Security Posture
- **Function Execution**: Direct execution of user-generated functions
- **Template System**: Dynamic template generation and evaluation
- **AI Provider Integration**: Uses shared AI Providers plugin

#### Security Vulnerabilities Identified
1. **Code Injection Risk**: User functions execute without sandboxing
2. **Resource Exhaustion**: No limits on function execution time/memory
3. **File System Access**: Functions may access unauthorized files
4. **Network Access**: Functions could make unauthorized network requests

#### Recommendations
1. Implement function sandboxing with restricted API access
2. Add execution time and memory limits
3. Whitelist allowed APIs and file system access
4. Validate all function metadata and templates

### Track Edits Security

#### Current Security Posture
- **Data Storage**: Uses Obsidian vault storage with compression
- **State Management**: Complex state with crash recovery
- **Performance Optimization**: Background processing and memory management

#### Security Vulnerabilities Identified
1. **Data Exposure**: Edit history may contain sensitive information
2. **State Corruption**: Malicious state could crash or compromise plugin
3. **Memory Leaks**: Potential DoS through memory exhaustion
4. **Persistence Vulnerabilities**: Unsafe deserialization of stored data

#### Recommendations
1. Implement data sanitization for stored edit history
2. Add state validation and corruption detection
3. Enhance memory management with strict limits
4. Secure deserialization with input validation

### Writerr Chat Security

#### Current Security Posture
- **Mode System**: Dynamic loading of user-defined modes
- **AI Integration**: Secure integration through AI Providers plugin
- **Context Handling**: Preserves conversation context

#### Security Vulnerabilities Identified
1. **Mode Injection**: User modes could contain malicious prompts
2. **Context Leakage**: Sensitive information in conversation history
3. **Template Injection**: Mode templates could execute unintended code
4. **Response Manipulation**: Malicious modes could manipulate AI responses

#### Recommendations
1. Implement strict mode validation and sanitization
2. Add context filtering to remove sensitive information
3. Sandbox template execution with restricted capabilities
4. Validate and sanitize AI responses before display

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Security Fixes (High Priority)
1. Function sandboxing for ai-editorial-functions
2. Input sanitization framework for all plugins
3. Secure state validation for track-edits
4. Mode validation for writerr-chat

### Phase 2: Enhanced Security (Medium Priority)
1. Error handling improvements
2. Logging security enhancements
3. Performance-based DoS prevention
4. Enhanced API validation

### Phase 3: Production Hardening (Low Priority)
1. Security monitoring integration
2. Vulnerability scanning automation
3. Security testing framework
4. Incident response procedures

## Security Testing Requirements

### Automated Testing
- [ ] Function sandbox bypass attempts
- [ ] Input validation fuzzing
- [ ] State corruption testing
- [ ] Mode injection testing
- [ ] Resource exhaustion testing

### Manual Testing  
- [ ] Code review of all user input handling
- [ ] AI response validation testing
- [ ] Cross-plugin communication security
- [ ] Error handling security review

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Privacy
- User content handling in edit tracking
- AI conversation history storage
- Function metadata and templates

### Security Standards
- Input validation best practices
- Secure coding guidelines
- Error handling standards
- Logging security requirements

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of function sandboxing
2. Create input sanitization framework
3. Implement security validation tests
4. Establish security monitoring
5. Document security procedures
