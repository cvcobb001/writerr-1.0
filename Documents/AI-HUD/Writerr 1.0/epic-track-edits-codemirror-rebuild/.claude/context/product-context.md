# Product Context

## Target Users

### Primary User: Development Teams Using Claude Code
- **Profile**: Software development teams (2-10 people) who have adopted Claude Code for AI-assisted development
- **Pain Points**: 
  - Context evaporates between sessions
  - Parallel work creates conflicts
  - Requirements drift from verbal decisions
  - Progress becomes invisible until delivery
- **Goals**: Ship higher quality software faster with full traceability
- **Current State**: Working with Claude Code but lacking structured workflows

### Secondary User: Solo Developers
- **Profile**: Individual developers using AI assistance for personal or small projects
- **Pain Points**: 
  - Losing track of what was planned vs. what was built
  - "Vibe coding" leading to technical debt
  - Difficulty onboarding others to existing work
- **Goals**: Maintain professional development standards even in solo work
- **Current State**: Ad-hoc development practices with AI assistance

### Tertiary User: Engineering Managers
- **Profile**: Technical leaders overseeing Claude Code adoption in their teams
- **Pain Points**: 
  - Lack of visibility into AI-assisted development progress
  - Difficulty coordinating multiple AI-human development streams
  - Inability to maintain quality standards with AI assistance
- **Goals**: Scale AI-assisted development while maintaining team coordination and code quality
- **Current State**: Experimenting with AI development tools but lacking governance

## Core Use Cases

### Use Case 1: New Feature Development
- **Trigger**: Product requirement or user story identified
- **Flow**: PRD creation → Epic planning → Task decomposition → Parallel execution → Delivery
- **Value**: Structured approach prevents scope creep and ensures quality
- **Success Metrics**: Faster delivery, fewer bugs, complete documentation

### Use Case 2: Technical Debt Resolution
- **Trigger**: Code quality issues or architectural improvements needed
- **Flow**: Problem analysis → Technical PRD → Refactoring plan → Systematic execution
- **Value**: Deliberate technical improvements rather than ad-hoc fixes
- **Success Metrics**: Improved code quality, reduced future maintenance

### Use Case 3: Team Onboarding
- **Trigger**: New team member or handoff required
- **Flow**: Context review → Epic analysis → Task assignment → Mentored execution
- **Value**: Complete project history and decision context available
- **Success Metrics**: Faster onboarding, consistent development practices

### Use Case 4: Parallel Development
- **Trigger**: Multiple features or large feature requiring parallel work
- **Flow**: Epic decomposition → Parallel task identification → Agent orchestration → Integration
- **Value**: Multiple development streams without conflicts
- **Success Metrics**: Reduced development time, clean integration

## Product Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### PRD Management
- Create comprehensive product requirements through guided brainstorming
- Edit and version existing PRDs
- Track PRD implementation status across multiple epics
- Link PRDs to business objectives and success metrics

#### Epic Planning
- Transform PRDs into technical implementation plans
- Define architectural decisions and dependencies
- Break down epics into parallelizable tasks
- Maintain traceability from requirements to implementation

#### Task Execution
- Launch specialized agents for different types of work
- Coordinate parallel execution across multiple tasks
- Track progress and maintain context between sessions
- Sync updates to GitHub for team visibility

#### Team Collaboration
- Multiple Claude instances working on same project
- Human-AI handoffs with preserved context
- Real-time progress visibility through GitHub integration
- Audit trail of all decisions and changes

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Fast local operations (< 1 second for most commands)
- Minimal context loading time
- Efficient GitHub API usage
- Scalable to projects with 100+ issues

#### Reliability
- Graceful handling of network interruptions
- State recovery from partial operations
- Consistent behavior across different environments
- Automatic validation of system integrity

#### Usability
- Intuitive command naming and structure
- Clear error messages with recovery guidance
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
- Minimal learning curve for Claude Code users

#### Maintainability
- Modular architecture for easy extension
- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive documentation
- Standard tools and practices only

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
- 75% reduction in context-switching overhead
- 3-5x more parallel tasks per developer
- 80% fewer bugs due to structured planning
- 90% reduction in "what was I working on?" questions

### Qualitative Indicators
- Developers prefer structured workflow over ad-hoc development
- Teams report improved coordination and visibility
- Code reviews focus on implementation rather than requirements clarification
- New team members onboard faster with complete context

### Adoption Metrics
- Teams continue using system after initial trial period
- Organic growth through word-of-mouth recommendations
- Integration into existing development workflows
- Community contributions and extensions
