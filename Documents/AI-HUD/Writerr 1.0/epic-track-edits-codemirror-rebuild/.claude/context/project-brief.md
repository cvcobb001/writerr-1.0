# Project Brief

## What It Does

**Claude Code PM** is a comprehensive project management system specifically designed for teams using Claude Code. It transforms unstructured AI-assisted development into a disciplined, traceable workflow that eliminates context loss and enables parallel execution.

The system provides a complete development lifecycle:
- **Guided PRD Creation**: Structured brainstorming to capture complete requirements
- **Technical Planning**: Transform product requirements into implementation roadmaps
- **Task Decomposition**: Break large features into parallelizable work streams
- **GitHub Integration**: Sync all work to GitHub Issues for team visibility
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple specialized AI agents working simultaneously
- **Progress Tracking**: Continuous updates and audit trail

## Why It Exists

### The Core Problem
Most Claude Code workflows operate in isolation - a single developer working with AI in their local environment. This creates fundamental problems:

1. **Context Evaporation**: Project knowledge disappears between sessions
2. **Serial Execution**: Only one task at a time, despite AI's parallel capabilities
3. **Invisible Progress**: Work happens in private conversations with no team visibility
4. **Requirements Drift**: Decisions made verbally override written specifications
5. **Integration Challenges**: Multiple AI-assisted streams create conflicts

### The Solution Approach
Instead of treating AI assistance as an enhanced individual workflow, this system treats it as a **team collaboration protocol** where humans and AI agents work together using GitHub as the coordination platform.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Workflow Management**: Complete PRD → Epic → Task → Code pipeline
- **GitHub Integration**: Issues, comments, labels, parent-child relationships
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents on different aspects of the same feature
- **Context Preservation**: Persistent state across sessions and handoffs
- **Team Coordination**: Multi-human, multi-AI collaboration patterns
- **Quality Assurance**: Spec-driven development with full traceability

### Out of Scope
- **Code Generation**: Focus is on workflow, not replacing Claude's coding capabilities
- **Project Management UI**: Uses GitHub's existing interfaces
- **Custom GitHub APIs**: Standard CLI and extensions only
- **Language-Specific Tools**: Framework-agnostic approach
- **Deployment Automation**: Focuses on development workflow

## Key Objectives

### Primary Objective: Eliminate Context Loss
- **Goal**: Never lose project state between sessions
- **Approach**: Hierarchical context system (project → epic → task)
- **Success**: Developers can resume work instantly with full context

### Secondary Objective: Enable True Parallel Development
- **Goal**: Multiple AI agents working simultaneously without conflicts
- **Approach**: Task decomposition with parallel execution flags
- **Success**: 3-5x more concurrent work streams per developer

### Tertiary Objective: Create Team Transparency
- **Goal**: Make AI-assisted development visible and collaborative
- **Approach**: GitHub Issues as single source of truth
- **Success**: Teams can coordinate AI and human work seamlessly

## Success Criteria

### Developer Experience
- Context loading time < 2 seconds
- Zero "what was I working on?" moments
- Seamless handoffs between sessions
- Clear next actions always available

### Team Coordination
- Real-time visibility into AI progress
- Human-AI handoffs work smoothly
- Multiple parallel streams don't conflict
- Complete audit trail for all decisions

### Quality Outcomes
- 75% reduction in bug rates due to spec-driven development
- 90% less time lost to context switching
- 3x faster feature delivery through parallelization
- 100% traceability from idea to production

## Strategic Vision

### Short Term (3-6 months)
- Establish Claude Code PM as standard workflow for AI-assisted development teams
- Prove parallel execution increases velocity without sacrificing quality
- Build community of practice around spec-driven AI development

### Medium Term (6-12 months)
- Integration with popular development tools and IDEs
- Advanced agent specialization for different domains (UI, API, data)
- Multi-project coordination and portfolio management

### Long Term (12+ months)
- Industry standard for AI-human collaborative development
- Platform for next-generation development team structures
- Foundation for AI-native software engineering practices

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **GitHub API Rate Limits**: Local-first approach minimizes API calls
- **Context Size Limits**: Hierarchical context system prevents bloat
- **Agent Coordination**: Clear boundaries and communication protocols

### Adoption Risks
- **Learning Curve**: Progressive disclosure and familiar patterns
- **Tool Fragmentation**: Uses standard tools teams already know
- **Change Resistance**: Incremental adoption path from existing workflows
