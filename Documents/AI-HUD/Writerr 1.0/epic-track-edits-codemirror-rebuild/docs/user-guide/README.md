# Writerr User Guide

Welcome to Writerr, the comprehensive AI editorial platform for Obsidian. Writerr transforms your writing workflow through three powerful, interconnected plugins that work together to provide unprecedented control over AI-assisted editing.

## What is Writerr?

Writerr is built on the **HUD Philosophy** - giving you complete Human control, Understanding of all changes, and Decision-making power over AI suggestions. Unlike traditional AI writing tools that make changes automatically, Writerr shows you every suggestion, lets you evaluate each edit, and maintains complete transparency in the editorial process.

### The Three-Plugin Architecture

**üîß Track Edits Plugin** - Universal change management system that captures, visualizes, and helps you control all text modifications with intelligent clustering and batch processing.

**üí¨ Writerr Chat Plugin** - Sophisticated conversational AI interface with dynamic mode switching and unlimited customization through your /Modes folder.

**‚öôÔ∏è AI Editorial Functions Plugin** - Dynamic function registry that hot-loads editorial behaviors from user-editable files, enabling unlimited specialized AI editors.

## Core Concepts

### The HUD Philosophy
- **Human Control**: You make every decision about changes to your text
- **Understanding**: Every AI suggestion is clearly explained and categorized  
- **Decision Power**: Accept, reject, or modify any suggestion with full context

### Universal Change Pipeline
All text modifications - whether from chat modes, editorial functions, or manual edits - flow through the Track Edits system, ensuring consistent visualization and control.

### Dynamic Loading
Both chat modes and editorial functions are loaded dynamically from markdown files in your vault, allowing you to create, modify, and share custom behaviors without plugin updates.

### Session Learning
Writerr learns from your acceptance/rejection patterns to improve future suggestions and adapt to your writing style and preferences.
