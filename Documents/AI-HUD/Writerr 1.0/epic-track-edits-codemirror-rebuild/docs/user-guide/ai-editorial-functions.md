# AI Editorial Functions Plugin Guide

The AI Editorial Functions plugin provides a dynamic function registry that hot-loads editorial behaviors from user-editable files, enabling unlimited specialized AI editors with constraint enforcement and session learning. This guide covers everything from using built-in functions to creating your own specialized editors.

## Core Concepts

### Dynamic Function Registry
Unlike traditional plugins with fixed behaviors, AI Editorial Functions loads specialized editors from `.md` files in your vault:
- **Hot Reload**: Function definitions update instantly when files change
- **Unlimited Customization**: Create as many specialized functions as needed
- **No Plugin Updates**: Modify behavior without touching plugin code
- **Community Sharing**: Share function definitions as simple text files

### Function-Based Editing
Each function is a specialized AI editor designed for specific tasks:
- **Copy Editor**: Grammar, punctuation, and mechanical corrections
- **Proofreader**: Final polish and error detection  
- **Developmental Editor**: Structure, flow, and content development
- **Style Editor**: Tone, voice, and stylistic consistency
- **Custom Functions**: Unlimited specialized editors you create

### Session Learning
Functions adapt to your preferences over time:
- **Acceptance Patterns**: Learn from which suggestions you accept/reject
- **Style Preferences**: Adapt to your writing style and voice
- **Context Awareness**: Remember previous work and maintain consistency  
- **Drift Detection**: Alert when function behavior changes unexpectedly

### Constraint System
Built-in safeguards ensure functions behave appropriately:
- **Forbidden Phrases**: Block inappropriate or unwanted suggestions
- **Action Constraints**: Limit what functions can and cannot do
- **Content Filters**: Ensure suggestions are appropriate and safe
- **Quality Controls**: Validate function outputs before presenting

## Interface Overview

### Function Execution

Functions can be triggered in multiple ways:

**Command Palette**:
```
Cmd/Ctrl+P → Type function name → Enter
Example: "Copy Editor" or "Proofreader"
```

**Right-Click Context Menu**:
```
Select text → Right-click → AI Editorial Functions → [Function Name]
```

**Keyboard Shortcuts**:
```
Configurable shortcuts for frequently used functions
Default: Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+[Number] for first 9 functions
```

**Batch Processing**:
```
Select multiple paragraphs → Run function → Process all selections
```

### Function Status Panel

Monitor function execution and results:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ AI Editorial Functions Status           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ● Copy Editor: Processing paragraph 2/5 │
│ ● Proofreader: Completed (12 suggestions)│
│ ○ Style Guide: Ready                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Last Run: Copy Editor (2:34 PM)        │
│ Success Rate: 94% (last 50 functions)   │
│ Session Learning: 12 adaptations        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Results Integration

All function outputs flow through Track Edits:
- **Automatic Attribution**: Changes labeled with specific function name
- **Confidence Scores**: Each suggestion includes AI confidence level
- **Batch Configuration**: Functions can configure how suggestions are processed
- **Category Assignment**: Changes automatically categorized by type

## Built-in Functions

Fix: Change confidence_range: ["low", "high"] 
  to confidence_range: [0.6, 0.9]

Function disabled until fixed.
```

## Session Learning System

### Adaptation Mechanisms

Functions learn from your editing patterns:

**Acceptance Pattern Learning**:
```
Copy Editor Session Learning:
- Grammar suggestions: 94% acceptance rate → Increase confidence
- Style suggestions: 67% acceptance rate → Maintain current approach  
- Clarity suggestions: 45% acceptance rate → Reduce confidence, require more context

Adaptations Made:
- Reduced style change suggestions by 20%
- Increased explanation detail for clarity changes
- Raised confidence threshold for grammar suggestions to 0.9
```

**Style Preference Learning**:
```
User Style Profile (Based on 500 editing decisions):
- Prefers active voice (87% of passive voice suggestions accepted)
- Likes concise language (92% of wordiness suggestions accepted)
- Maintains formal tone (34% of informal style suggestions accepted)
- Uses Oxford commas (98% of Oxford comma suggestions accepted)

Function Adaptations:
- Prioritize active voice suggestions
- Increase confidence for conciseness changes
- Reduce formality change suggestions
- Auto-suggest Oxford commas with high confidence
```

**Content-Aware Learning**:
```
Document Type Adaptations:
- Academic papers: Increase precision, reduce creative suggestions
- Blog posts: Increase engagement suggestions, reduce formality
- Technical docs: Prioritize clarity, maintain technical accuracy
- Creative writing: Reduce grammar rigidity, increase style flexibility

Context Learning:
- Morning editing sessions: More conservative suggestions
- Revision phases: More aggressive improvement suggestions  
- Final drafts: Focus on accuracy over creativity
```

### Drift Detection

**Performance Monitoring**:
```
Copy Editor Drift Alert:
Unusual pattern detected in last 10 sessions:

Normal Behavior:
- Average suggestions per run: 8.3
- Average confidence: 0.84
- Acceptance rate: 78%

Recent Behavior (Last 10 runs):
- Average suggestions per run: 15.7 (89% increase)
- Average confidence: 0.71 (15% decrease)  
- Acceptance rate: 52% (33% decrease)

Possible Causes:
1. Function definition recently modified
2. AI model behavior change
