# Issue #5 Analysis: AI Editorial Functions Plugin

## Parallel Work Streams

### Stream A: Function Registry & Hot Reload Engine
**Agent Type:** general-purpose  
**Can Start:** Immediately  
**Dependencies:** Foundation infrastructure (completed)  
**Files:**
- `packages/ai-editorial-functions/src/registry/`
- `packages/ai-editorial-functions/src/loader/`
- `packages/ai-editorial-functions/src/watcher/`

**Scope:**
- Dynamic function loading from .md/.xml files with hot-reload capability
- Function lifecycle management (load, validate, execute, unload)
- File system monitoring with robust change detection
- Version control and rollback capabilities
- Function dependency resolution and validation

### Stream B: Definition Parsing & Validation System
**Agent Type:** code-analyzer  
**Can Start:** Immediately  
**Dependencies:** None initially, Stream A for integration  
**Files:**
- `packages/ai-editorial-functions/src/parser/`
- `packages/ai-editorial-functions/src/validation/`
- `packages/ai-editorial-functions/src/schema/`

**Scope:**
- Robust markdown parser with YAML frontmatter support
- XML parser for advanced function definitions
- Comprehensive validation with user-friendly error messages
- JSON schema validation for function metadata and outputs
- Template generation for new function creation

### Stream C: Default Function Library Implementation
**Agent Type:** general-purpose  
**Can Start:** After Stream B has basic parsing  
**Dependencies:** Stream B (parsing system)  
**Files:**
- `packages/ai-editorial-functions/functions/`
- `packages/ai-editorial-functions/src/builtin/`
- `packages/ai-editorial-functions/src/templates/`

**Scope:**
- Four default functions: Copy Editor, Proofreader, Developmental Editor, Co-Writer
- Function-specific behavior and prompt engineering
- Template system for user-created functions
- Examples and documentation for each function type
- Integration with Track Edits per function requirements

### Stream D: Constraint Enforcement & Safety
**Agent Type:** code-analyzer  
**Can Start:** After Stream B completes basic validation  
**Dependencies:** Stream B (validation framework)  
**Files:**
- `packages/ai-editorial-functions/src/constraints/`
- `packages/ai-editorial-functions/src/safety/`
- `packages/ai-editorial-functions/src/sandbox/`

**Scope:**
- Constraint enforcement engine for forbidden phrases and actions
- Sandboxed execution environment for user-defined functions
- Output validation against defined schemas
- Quality scoring and confidence measurement
- Safety checks and security validation

### Stream E: Session Learning & Integration
**Agent Type:** general-purpose  
**Can Start:** After Streams A, B have basic implementations  
**Dependencies:** Streams A (registry), B (validation), completed plugins  
**Files:**
- `packages/ai-editorial-functions/src/learning/`
- `packages/ai-editorial-functions/src/integration/`
- `packages/ai-editorial-functions/src/performance/`

**Scope:**
- Session learning system with user feedback integration
- Track Edits integration with per-function configuration
- AI Providers integration for model access
- Performance monitoring and resource management
- Function prioritization and selection system

## Coordination Notes

- **Stream A** must complete basic registry before Stream E can integrate
- **Stream B** must complete basic parsing before Streams C and D can work effectively
- **Stream C** can start with simple function definitions while B completes advanced features
- **Stream D** needs Stream B's validation framework before implementing constraints
- **Stream E** requires basic implementations from A and B before starting

## Critical Dependencies

- Foundation Infrastructure (completed ✅)
- Track Edits Plugin (completed ✅) - for function output routing
- Writerr Chat Plugin (completed ✅) - for mode integration
- AI Providers Plugin SDK integration
- File system monitoring APIs
- JSON schema validation libraries

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Function loading success rate >98%
- [ ] Hot-reload applies changes in <200ms
- [ ] Support 100+ custom functions simultaneously
- [ ] Zero security breaches from user-defined functions
- [ ] Function execution completes in <5 seconds
- [ ] Memory usage scales linearly with active functions
- [ ] User can create working custom function within 30 minutes
