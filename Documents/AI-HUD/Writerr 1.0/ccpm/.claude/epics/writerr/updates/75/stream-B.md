# Stream B Progress: Comprehensive Test Suite Implementation

## Overview
Implementing comprehensive test suite for all three Writerr plugins with focus on integration testing, performance benchmarking, security validation, and user acceptance testing.

## Scope Analysis
**Current State**: Basic unit tests exist for ai-editorial-functions registry system. Need to expand to comprehensive integration and performance testing across all plugins.

**Plugins to Test**:
- `packages/track-edits/` - Universal change management system
- `packages/writerr-chat/` - Conversational AI interface with dynamic modes  
- `packages/ai-editorial-functions/` - Dynamic function registry with hot reloading
- `packages/shared/` - Event bus and plugin communication
- System integration across all components

## Progress Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Analyzed existing codebase and test infrastructure
- [x] Created stream progress tracking file
- [x] Reviewed current test setup (Jest + TypeScript)

### üîÑ In Progress  
- [ ] Create integration tests for track-edits plugin
- [ ] Create integration tests for writerr-chat plugin  
- [ ] Create integration tests for ai-editorial-functions plugin

### ‚è≥ Pending
- [ ] Create performance tests for all plugins
- [ ] Create security tests for user-generated content
- [ ] Create system-wide test scenarios  
- [ ] Create memory leak detection tests
- [ ] Create user acceptance tests with realistic scenarios
- [ ] Update test infrastructure and documentation

## Test Strategy

### Integration Tests
- **Plugin Communication**: Event bus messaging between plugins
- **Track Edits Integration**: AI functions ‚Üí Track Edits ‚Üí UI updates
- **Mode Loading**: Dynamic mode loading in Writerr Chat
- **Function Hot Reload**: Live function updates without plugin restart
- **AI Providers Integration**: Centralized AI model access across plugins

### Performance Tests
- **Large Document Handling**: Test with 100K+ word documents
- **Memory Usage**: Track memory consumption during extended sessions
- **Function Loading Speed**: Measure hot reload performance (<200ms target)
- **Batch Processing**: Handle 50+ simultaneous changes without lag
- **Startup Performance**: Plugin initialization time measurement

### Security Tests  
- **Function Sandboxing**: Validate user-generated function isolation
- **Input Sanitization**: Test XSS and injection attack vectors
- **File System Access**: Ensure functions can't access restricted paths
- **API Security**: Validate AI Providers integration security

### User Acceptance Tests
- **Complete Workflows**: End-to-end editing scenarios
- **Custom Function Creation**: Test user function creation and modification
- **Mode Switching**: Validate seamless mode transitions
- **Change Review Process**: Test granular accept/reject workflows
- **Error Recovery**: Test graceful failure handling

## Technical Approach

### Test Infrastructure
- **Framework**: Jest with TypeScript support
- **Mocking**: Obsidian API mocks for plugin testing
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage tracking across all components
- **Verbose Output**: Debug-friendly test output for troubleshooting

### Test Organization
```
packages/*/tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/     # Cross-component integration tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ performance/     # Performance benchmarks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ security/        # Security validation tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ acceptance/      # User workflow tests

tests/system/        # System-wide test scenarios
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/       # End-to-end user workflows
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stress/          # Load and stress testing
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ compatibility/   # Plugin ecosystem compatibility
```

## Next Actions
1. Create integration test suite for track-edits plugin
2. Implement cross-plugin communication tests
3. Build performance benchmarking framework
4. Develop realistic user acceptance scenarios

## Coordination Notes
- Working in parallel with 4 other streams
- Creating tests that validate other streams' implementations
- Focus on realistic scenarios, not mock-heavy cheater tests
- Ensuring no conflicts with existing plugin functionality
