# Stream E Progress: Security Audit & Production Preparation

**Stream:** Security Audit & Production Preparation  
**Task:** Issue #6 (Integration & Testing) - Stream E  
**Started:** 2025-08-21  
**Status:** In Progress  

## Work Completed

### Initial Assessment
- [x] Read task requirements from .claude/epics/writerr/75.md
- [x] Analyzed current project structure 
- [x] Identified security scope across all 3 plugin packages
- [x] Created progress tracking file

### Security Analysis Phase
- [ ] User-generated function sandboxing validation
- [ ] Input sanitization testing and implementation  
- [ ] Permission and access control verification
- [ ] Data privacy and security audit

### Production Preparation Phase
- [ ] Production deployment configurations
- [ ] Error monitoring and logging system implementation
- [ ] Security vulnerability scanning and remediation

## Current Focus
Starting comprehensive security analysis of all three plugins:
- ai-editorial-functions: User-generated function execution security
- writerr-chat: AI provider integration and mode parsing security
- track-edits: Data persistence and state management security

## Next Steps
1. Create security audit framework and directory structure
2. Implement sandboxing validation for user-generated functions
3. Review and enhance input sanitization across all plugins
4. Set up production deployment configurations
5. Implement comprehensive error monitoring

## Issues/Blockers
None identified yet.
