# Stream C: Default Function Library Implementation

## Scope
Four default functions: Copy Editor, Proofreader, Developmental Editor, Co-Writer. Function-specific behavior and prompt engineering, template system for user-created functions, examples and documentation for each function type, integration with Track Edits per function requirements.

## Files
- packages/ai-editorial-functions/functions/
- packages/ai-editorial-functions/src/builtin/
- packages/ai-editorial-functions/src/templates/

## Progress
- ✅ Created functions/ directory structure for default function library
- ✅ Implemented Copy Editor function with comprehensive prompt engineering and voice preservation
- ✅ Implemented Proofreader function with high-confidence grammar and spelling corrections
- ✅ Implemented Developmental Editor function with structural analysis and content guidance
- ✅ Implemented Co-Writer function with voice matching and creative content generation
- ✅ Created builtin/ directory with full TypeScript implementations for all default functions
- ✅ Built comprehensive template system for user-created functions with validation
- ✅ Added extensive examples and documentation including specialized functions
- ✅ Configured Track Edits integration with function-specific batching and clustering
- ✅ Validated all function definitions work correctly with Stream B parsing system

## Implementation Summary

### Default Function Library (functions/)
- **copy-editor.md**: Professional copy editing with minimal intervention and voice preservation
- **proofreader.md**: Technical proofreading with 95%+ confidence corrections
- **developmental-editor.md**: Structural analysis and content development guidance
- **co-writer.md**: Creative content generation with voice matching capabilities
- **examples/**: Additional specialized functions (academic proofreader, creative writing enhancer)
- **README.md**: Comprehensive documentation and usage guidelines

### Built-in TypeScript Implementations (src/builtin/)
- **CopyEditor.ts**: Implementation with voice analysis and style preservation
- **Proofreader.ts**: High-precision grammar/spelling correction with confidence scoring
- **DevelopmentalEditor.ts**: Structural analysis with recommendations and gap identification
- **CoWriter.ts**: Content generation with voice matching and creative assistance
- **BuiltinFunctionManager.ts**: Centralized management and configuration system
- **TrackEditsIntegration.ts**: Comprehensive integration with change categorization

### Template System (src/templates/)
- **TemplateGenerator.ts**: Dynamic function generation from customizable templates
- **FunctionTemplateManager.ts**: Template management with interactive creation flow
- **types.ts**: Comprehensive type definitions for template system
- Built-in templates for copy editor, specialized proofreader, and creative writing assistant

### Track Edits Integration Features
- Function-specific batching strategies (immediate, batch, defer)
- Intelligent clustering (none, sentence, paragraph, section)
- Confidence-based auto-application thresholds
- Change categorization and color coding
- Review requirement configuration per function type

### Key Innovations
1. **Voice Preservation**: Advanced voice analysis and matching for seamless integration
2. **Confidence-Based Processing**: Different confidence thresholds for different error types
3. **Modular Architecture**: Pluggable system supporting unlimited custom functions
4. **Template-Driven Creation**: User-friendly system for creating specialized functions
5. **Comprehensive Integration**: Deep Track Edits integration with intelligent change management

## Status: COMPLETED ✅
All deliverables implemented, tested, and validated. Ready for integration testing with Stream A and Stream D components.
