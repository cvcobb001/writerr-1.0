# Stream A: Function Registry & Hot Reload Engine

## Scope
Dynamic function loading from .md/.xml files with hot-reload capability, function lifecycle management (load, validate, execute, unload), file system monitoring with robust change detection, version control and rollback capabilities, function dependency resolution and validation.

## Files
- packages/ai-editorial-functions/src/registry/
- packages/ai-editorial-functions/src/loader/
- packages/ai-editorial-functions/src/watcher/

## Progress
✅ **COMPLETED** - All core functionality implemented and working

### Completed Features
- ✅ Comprehensive type system for editorial functions
- ✅ FunctionRegistry with full lifecycle management
- ✅ FunctionLoader supporting .md/.xml parsing with YAML frontmatter
- ✅ FileWatcher with debounced hot-reload monitoring  
- ✅ LifecycleManager coordinating all components
- ✅ Version control and rollback capabilities
- ✅ Function dependency resolution and validation
- ✅ Robust change detection with file system monitoring
- ✅ Comprehensive validation and error handling
- ✅ Full integration with shared event bus and foundation
- ✅ Updated main.ts plugin integration
- ✅ Example function definitions and basic tests
- ✅ Build system working and producing artifacts

### Key Deliverables
1. **Dynamic Function Loading System** - Complete implementation supporting both .md and .xml function definition files with comprehensive parsing of YAML frontmatter, system prompts, examples, schemas, and constraints.

2. **Hot-Reload Engine** - FileWatcher with debounced change detection, automatic function reloading, and lifecycle coordination that doesn't break active editorial sessions.

3. **Function Registry** - Central registry managing function lifecycle (load/validate/execute/unload), version control, dependency resolution, and execution queue management.

4. **Lifecycle Management** - Comprehensive system coordinating all components with error recovery, status tracking, and event-driven architecture.

5. **Foundation Integration** - Full integration with shared event bus, type system, and plugin architecture.

### Technical Highlights
- Event-driven architecture using shared global event bus
- Comprehensive type safety with TypeScript
- Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Memory management and resource cleanup
- Performance optimized with debouncing and queuing
- Extensible architecture supporting custom function types
- File system monitoring with cross-platform compatibility
- Version control enabling function rollbacks
- Dependency resolution preventing circular dependencies

### Files Created
- `src/types.ts` - Comprehensive type definitions
- `src/registry/FunctionRegistry.ts` - Core registry implementation  
- `src/registry/LifecycleManager.ts` - Lifecycle coordination
- `src/loader/FunctionLoader.ts` - File parsing and loading
- `src/watcher/FileWatcher.ts` - Hot-reload monitoring
- `src/main.ts` - Updated plugin integration
- `examples/copy-editor.md` - Example function definition
- `examples/proofreader.md` - Example function definition
- `tests/registry.test.ts` - Test suite

### Build Status
✅ TypeScript compilation successful with minor warnings
✅ Rollup bundling produces main.js artifact
✅ Ready for integration with other streams

This stream provides the complete foundation for dynamic AI editorial function loading and management, enabling unlimited specialized AI editors with hot-reload capability.
