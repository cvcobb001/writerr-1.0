# Issue #71 Analysis: Foundation Infrastructure

## Parallel Work Streams

### Stream A: Shared Type System & Event Bus
**Agent Type:** code-analyzer  
**Can Start:** Immediately  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Files:**
- `packages/shared/src/types/`
- `packages/shared/src/events/`
- `packages/shared/src/contracts/`

**Scope:**
- Define all TypeScript interfaces for data structures
- Implement type-safe global event bus
- Create API contracts between plugins
- Event filtering and routing capabilities
- Memory leak prevention and cleanup

### Stream B: Plugin Registry System
**Agent Type:** general-purpose  
**Can Start:** Immediately  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Files:**
- `packages/shared/src/registry/`
- `packages/shared/src/discovery/`

**Scope:**
- Dynamic plugin capability registration
- Service discovery and dependency resolution
- Version compatibility checking
- Plugin lifecycle management
- API exposure management

### Stream C: Build System & Project Structure
**Agent Type:** general-purpose  
**Can Start:** Immediately  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Files:**
- `package.json`
- `packages/*/package.json`
- `rollup.config.js` or `webpack.config.js`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `tsconfig.shared.json`

**Scope:**
- Mono-repo structure for three plugins
- TypeScript compilation configuration
- Hot reload development setup
- Production bundling and optimization
- Asset management for shared resources

### Stream D: Testing Framework & Utilities
**Agent Type:** test-runner  
**Can Start:** After Stream A completes (needs types)  
**Dependencies:** Stream A (shared types)  
**Files:**
- `packages/shared/src/utils/`
- `packages/shared/src/testing/`
- `packages/shared/src/errors/`
- `__tests__/` directories

**Scope:**
- Basic integration testing framework
- Shared utilities and helper functions
- Error handling framework
- Test setup for all plugins
- Performance monitoring utilities

## Coordination Notes

- **Stream A** must complete core types before Stream D can implement tests
- **Stream B** and **Stream C** can work completely independently
- **Stream D** should wait for at least the basic type definitions from Stream A

## Critical Dependencies

- All streams need Obsidian Plugin API types available
- TypeScript 5.0+ configuration must be established early
- Event bus implementation is foundational for later plugin development

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Type-safe inter-plugin communication working
- [ ] All three plugin directories created with build config
- [ ] Hot reload functioning in development
- [ ] Basic integration tests passing
- [ ] Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] Build time under 30 seconds
