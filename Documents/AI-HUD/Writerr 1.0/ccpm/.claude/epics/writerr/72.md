# Task 002: Track Edits Plugin

## Overview
Build the complete universal change management system that serves as the foundation for all text modifications in the Writerr ecosystem. This includes advanced diff algorithms, intelligent clustering, batch processing, and sophisticated visual controls.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Advanced change detection engine with word/phrase-level granularity
- [ ] Intelligent change clustering by category, confidence, proximity, or source
- [ ] Batch processing system with configurable thresholds and sizes
- [ ] Real-time inline visual diff rendering with smooth animations
- [ ] Granular accept/reject controls with keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Comprehensive source attribution system
- [ ] Per-document configuration with persistent state
- [ ] Session management with complete audit trail
- [ ] Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- [ ] Performance optimization for large documents (100K+ words)
- [ ] Change timeline and revision heatmap visualization
- [ ] Bulk operations with filtering capabilities

## Technical Requirements

### Change Detection Engine
- Custom diff algorithm optimized for real-time text analysis
- Word/phrase-level change identification
- Confidence scoring for AI-generated changes
- Change categorization (style, grammar, structure, content)
- Performance benchmarks: <100ms for 10K word documents

### Clustering System
- Machine learning-inspired clustering algorithms
- Configurable clustering strategies
- Dynamic cluster updates as changes are added
- Visual cluster representation in UI
- Batch submission of entire clusters

### Visual Interface
- React components with smooth animations
- Inline diff rendering with strikethrough + highlights
- Color coding by source and confidence
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Accessibility compliance (keyboard nav, screen readers)

### State Management
- Per-document tracking state persistence
- Session-based change history
- Crash recovery and state restoration
- Memory efficient storage for large documents
- Change compression for long-term storage

### Performance Optimization
- Virtual scrolling for large change lists
- Lazy loading of change history
- Debounced updates for real-time typing
- Memory management and cleanup
- Background processing for heavy operations

## Dependencies
- Foundation Infrastructure (Task 001)
- Obsidian Editor APIs
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Radix UI components
- Performance monitoring tools

## Integration Points
- Must expose APIs for Writerr Chat integration
- Must accept changes from AI Editorial Functions
- Must integrate with AI Providers plugin

## Estimated Effort
**105 hours (13 days)**

## Risks
- Complex diff algorithm performance
- Memory usage with large documents
- Visual rendering performance
- State persistence reliability

## Success Metrics
- Handle 100K+ word documents without lag
- Change detection accuracy >99.5%
- Visual updates render in <100ms
- Zero data loss during operations
- Memory usage <50MB for typical documents
