# Issue Analysis: Integration & Testing

## Parallel Work Streams

### Stream A: AI Providers Integration & Cross-Plugin Communication
**Agent:** general-purpose
**Can Start:** Immediately
**Dependencies:** None
**Files:**
- packages/*/src/integration/AIProvidersAdapter.ts (create adapters for each plugin)
- packages/*/src/communication/CrossPluginBridge.ts (create communication layer)
- packages/shared/src/events/CrossPluginEvents.ts (shared event definitions)

**Scope:**
- Unified AI model access across all three plugins
- Cross-plugin communication optimization
- Event bus enhancement for inter-plugin messaging
- Error handling and retry logic standardization

### Stream B: Comprehensive Test Suite Implementation
**Agent:** general-purpose  
**Can Start:** Immediately
**Dependencies:** None
**Files:**
- packages/*/tests/integration/ (integration test suites)
- packages/*/tests/performance/ (performance benchmarks)
- packages/*/tests/security/ (security validation tests)
- tests/system/ (system-wide test scenarios)

**Scope:**
- Unit tests for all core algorithms
- Integration tests for plugin communication
- Performance benchmarks and regression tests
- Security tests for user-generated content
- Memory leak detection tests

### Stream C: System Optimization & Performance Tuning
**Agent:** general-purpose
**Can Start:** Immediately  
**Dependencies:** None
**Files:**
- packages/*/src/performance/ (performance optimization)
- packages/*/src/monitoring/ (performance monitoring)
- packages/shared/src/optimization/ (shared optimizations)

**Scope:**
- Performance profiling and bottleneck identification
- Memory usage optimization
- Startup time optimization
- Hot-reload performance tuning
- Large document handling optimization

### Stream D: Documentation & Example Library Creation
**Agent:** general-purpose
**Can Start:** Immediately
**Dependencies:** None
**Files:**
- docs/user-guide/ (comprehensive user documentation)
- docs/api/ (developer API documentation) 
- examples/modes/ (mode examples)
- examples/functions/ (function examples)
- docs/tutorials/ (creation tutorials)

**Scope:**
- User guide for all three plugins
- Developer API documentation
- Function and mode creation tutorials
- Curated example library
- Video tutorial scripts

### Stream E: Security Audit & Production Preparation
**Agent:** general-purpose
**Can Start:** Immediately
**Dependencies:** None
**Files:**
- security/ (security audit reports)
- deployment/ (production deployment configs)
- monitoring/ (error monitoring setup)
- packages/*/src/security/ (security implementations)

**Scope:**
- User-generated function sandboxing validation
- Input sanitization testing
- Permission and access control verification
- Production deployment preparation
- Error monitoring and logging system

## Stream Dependencies
- All streams can start immediately as they work on different areas
- Stream coordination through shared event definitions
- Integration validation occurs across all streams

## Key Integration Points
1. **Global Event Bus**: All plugins communicate through enhanced event system
2. **AI Providers**: Unified access layer for all AI model calls  
3. **Track Edits**: Universal change management for all text modifications
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Cross-plugin metrics and optimization
5. **Security Framework**: Consistent security across all user-generated content

## Estimated Timeline
- **Parallel Execution**: 5 streams running simultaneously
- **Total Effort**: 43 hours distributed across streams
- **Target Completion**: 2-3 days with parallel execution

## Success Criteria
- All integration tests pass consistently
- System startup time <3 seconds
- Zero memory leaks during 8-hour usage sessions
- Cross-plugin communication latency <50ms
- User documentation rated >4.5/5 for clarity
- Beta users successfully create custom functions
