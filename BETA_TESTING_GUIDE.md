```markdown
Title: Track Edits highlighting disappears when switching between documents

Environment:
- Plugin Version: v1.1.0-beta.2
- Obsidian Version: 1.4.16
- OS: Windows 11

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Document A and make several edits (highlighting appears correctly)
2. Switch to Document B and make edits (highlighting appears correctly)  
3. Switch back to Document A
4. Edit highlighting from step 1 is no longer visible

Expected: Previous edit highlighting should persist when returning to Document A
