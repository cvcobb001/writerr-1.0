# POST-COMPACT DEVELOPMENT INSTRUCTIONS

## üö® CRITICAL: IMPLEMENT THE TRACK EDITS PLUGIN

**STATUS**: Epic plan completed, but ACTUAL CODE IMPLEMENTATION was NOT done.
**MANDATE**: Develop the plugin based on the comprehensive plan we created.

## üìç What Was Completed:
- ‚úÖ Epic planning and GitHub issues (#8-17) 
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive technical specifications
- ‚úÖ Detailed task breakdowns with acceptance criteria
- ‚úÖ Performance targets and testing strategies

## üéØ What MUST Be Done Next:
**ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE CODE** using the parallel agent execution methodology.

## üìã Development Plan Location:
```
/Users/chriscobb/Documents/AI-HUD/Writerr 1.0/ccpm/.claude/epics/track-edits-codemirror-rebuild/
```

### Key Files:
- `epic.md` - Complete technical architecture
- `8.md` through `17.md` - Detailed task specifications
- Each task has acceptance criteria, code examples, and implementation details

## üöÄ Implementation Process:

### Step 1: Review the Epic Plan
Read `/Users/chriscobb/Documents/AI-HUD/Writerr 1.0/ccpm/.claude/epics/track-edits-codemirror-rebuild/epic.md`

### Step 2: Execute Issues #8-17 in Order
For each issue, use the parallel-worker agent:

1. **Issue #8**: CodeMirror Integration Setup
2. **Issue #9**: ViewPlugin Implementation  
3. **Issue #10**: StateField Implementation
4. **Issue #11**: Decoration System Implementation
5. **Issue #12**: Change Detection and Transaction Processing
6. **Issue #13**: Edit Clustering Algorithm
7. **Issue #14**: Side Panel UI Implementation
8. **Issue #15**: AI Integration Component
9. **Issue #16**: Performance Optimization and Testing
10. **Issue #17**: Documentation and Final Polish

### Step 3: Use Parallel Agent Execution
For each issue:
```
Task(subagent_type="parallel-worker", prompt="Implement Issue #X based on specifications in X.md")
```

### Step 4: Target Implementation Location
```
/Users/chriscobb/Documents/AI-HUD/Writerr 1.0/ccpm/plugins/track-edits/src/
```

## üéØ Critical Architecture Requirements:

### CodeMirror-Native Integration:
- Direct `@codemirror/state` and `@codemirror/view` imports
- ViewPlugin for transaction monitoring with `update.changes.iterChanges()`
- StateField for decoration management with position mapping
- Extension registration via `this.registerEditorExtension([ViewPlugin, StateField])`

### Performance Targets:
- Decoration rendering: <16ms (60fps typing)
- Cluster recalculation: <100ms 
- Memory usage: <10MB for 1000 edits
- Scroll performance: No measurable impact

### Key Features to Implement:
- Real-time edit decorations (green additions, red strikethrough deletions)
- Intelligent edit clustering with 95% accuracy
- Side panel UI with cluster operations
- AI integration for pattern analysis
- Comprehensive performance optimization

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. **The current plugin at that location is from August 21st** - it needs to be completely rewritten
2. **Use the parallel agent methodology** - don't just simulate, actually implement
3. **Follow the detailed specifications** in each .md file exactly
4. **Test each issue completion** before moving to the next
5. **Build the plugin** after implementation with `npm run build`

## üîç Validation:
After implementation, verify:
- Fresh timestamps on all files
- Plugin works in Obsidian
- All acceptance criteria met
- Performance targets achieved

## üìù Context:
We spent 6+ hours creating this comprehensive plan and GitHub integration. The plan is excellent and ready for execution. The missing piece is the ACTUAL CODE IMPLEMENTATION.

**DO NOT repeat the documentation-only approach. IMPLEMENT THE ACTUAL PLUGIN CODE.**

**Epic Status**: Plan Complete ‚úÖ | Implementation Required ‚ùå
**Next Action**: Execute parallel agent implementation of Issues #8-17
