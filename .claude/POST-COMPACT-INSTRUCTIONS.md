# POST-COMPACT INSTRUCTIONS

## üéâ CURRENT STATUS: ‚úÖ TRACK EDITS PLUGIN FULLY WORKING

**STATUS**: Plugin successfully restored to working state with fixed build configuration.
**LAST VERIFIED**: August 25th - Plugin loads, tracks edits, decorations working properly.

## üìç What Was Successfully Fixed:
- ‚úÖ CodeMirror extension conflict resolved (externalized @codemirror/state and @codemirror/view)
- ‚úÖ Plugin size restored to normal: 68.8KB (was bloated to 464KB)
- ‚úÖ All edit tracking functionality confirmed working (decorations, real-time change detection)
- ‚úÖ Plugin loads without errors and tracks edits properly in Obsidian
- ‚úÖ Working directory confirmed: `/Users/chriscobb/Documents/AI-HUD/Writerr 1.0/ccpm/`

## üéØ Next Steps Available:
Choose one of the following approaches:

### OPTION A: Restore Toggle Components (Recommended)
- **Toggle components backed up** at: `/tmp/toggle-backup/`
- **Files available**: `ToggleConfirmationModal.ts`, `ToggleStateManager.ts`, `jest.config.js`, `shared-mock.ts`
- **Action**: Copy back to `src/components/` and `src/ui/` directories
- **Rebuild** with: `npm run build:track-edits`
- **Test** toggle functionality integration

### OPTION B: Use CCPM Framework for New Features  
- **CCPM commands available** at: `.claude/commands/pm/`
- **Current branch**: `master` (in working state)
- **Use structured task management** for any new development

### OPTION C: Build New Features
- **Foundation solid**: Edit tracking, decorations, CodeMirror integration all working
- **Build configuration correct**: CodeMirror externalization in place
- **Ready for**: Additional features, UI improvements, toggle operations

## üö® CRITICAL BUILD CONFIGURATION (DO NOT CHANGE):
```bash
# These externals MUST remain in package.json build commands:
--external:@codemirror/state --external:@codemirror/view
```

**Why**: Prevents "multiple instances of @codemirror/state" errors by using Obsidian's built-in CodeMirror

## ‚úÖ CURRENT PLUGIN STATUS:
- **Location**: `/Users/chriscobb/Documents/AI-HUD/Writerr 1.0/ccpm/plugins/track-edits/`
- **Size**: 68.8KB (normal, healthy size)
- **Build time**: 14ms (fast)
- **Functionality**: ‚úÖ All core features working
  - Edit tracking with real-time decorations
  - StateField managing decorations properly  
  - ViewPlugin detecting changes
  - Side panel UI operational
  - AI integration functional

## üîß KEY COMMANDS:
```bash
cd "/Users/chriscobb/Documents/AI-HUD/Writerr 1.0/ccpm"
npm run build:track-edits  # Builds with correct externals
npm run clean              # Cleans build artifacts
git status                 # Check current state
```

## üìã VERIFICATION COMPLETED:
‚úÖ Plugin loads without CodeMirror errors  
‚úÖ Edit tracking creates decorations in real-time  
‚úÖ StateField manages decorations properly  
‚úÖ Debug output confirms functionality  
‚úÖ Normal file size (68.8KB)  
‚úÖ Fast build time (14ms)

## üö® WHAT NOT TO DO:
- **DO NOT** remove CodeMirror externalization from build commands
- **DO NOT** bundle `@codemirror/state` or `@codemirror/view` 
- **DO NOT** assume plugin needs complete rewrite - it's working!

## üìà READY FOR:
- Toggle component integration
- New feature development  
- UI enhancements
- Performance optimizations
- Testing new functionality

The plugin is in **excellent working condition** - a solid foundation for any new development!
