# Stream C: Build System & Project Structure - Issue #71

## Progress Log

**Stream:** Build System & Project Structure  
**Started:** 2025-08-21  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### Completed
- ✅ Created progress tracking structure
- ✅ Set up mono-repo structure with packages for: shared, track-edits, writerr-chat, ai-editorial-functions
- ✅ TypeScript 5.0+ configuration for all packages with project references
- ✅ Hot reload development setup with concurrency support
- ✅ Production bundling and optimization with Rollup
- ✅ Asset management for shared resources
- ✅ Testing pipeline integration with Jest

### Target Performance Metrics
- Build time under 30 seconds: ⚠️ (needs testing with full implementation)
- Hot reload working reliably: ✅ (configured with watch mode)
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors: ✅ (strict mode configured)

## Files Created/Modified
- `package.json` - Root workspace configuration
- `packages/*/package.json` - Individual package configurations  
- `tsconfig.json` - Root TypeScript project references
- `tsconfig.shared.json` - Shared TypeScript configuration
