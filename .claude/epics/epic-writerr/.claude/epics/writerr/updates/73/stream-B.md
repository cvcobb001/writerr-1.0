## Current Status: Starting Implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Set up package.json with React 18 and Radix UI dependencies
- [x] Created directory structure for components, ui, and interface
- [x] Created progress tracking file

## In Progress Tasks
- [ ] Setting up TypeScript types and interfaces
- [ ] Building core chat components
- [ ] Implementing mode selection dropdown
- [ ] Creating large text areas with proper keyboard handling

## Next Steps
1. Create TypeScript interfaces for modes and chat state
2. Build the main ChatInterface component
3. Implement ModeSelector dropdown with mock modes
4. Create MessageArea with large text input
5. Add keyboard shortcuts (Enter for newlines, Cmd+Enter to send)
6. Implement responsive design and accessibility

## Notes
- Working with React 18 + TypeScript + Radix UI
- Using mock modes initially, preparing for Stream A integration
- Focus on writer-friendly UI with clear visual hierarchy
- Ensuring session continuity across mode switches
