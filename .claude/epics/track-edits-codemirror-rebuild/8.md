## Description

Set up the foundational CodeMirror integration for the Track Edits plugin. This involves importing necessary CodeMirror modules, establishing type definitions, and creating the basic plugin structure that will serve as the foundation for edit tracking functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Import required CodeMirror 6 modules (EditorView, ViewPlugin, StateField, etc.)
- [x] Set up TypeScript type definitions for CodeMirror integration
- [x] Create basic plugin structure with proper extension registration
- [x] Establish integration points with existing Obsidian plugin architecture
- [x] Verify CodeMirror editor instance access from Obsidian
- [x] Create utility functions for editor state management
- [x] Add error handling for CodeMirror integration failures

## Technical Requirements

### CodeMirror Imports
```typescript
import {
  EditorView,
  ViewPlugin,
  ViewUpdate,
  Decoration,
  DecorationSet
} from '@codemirror/view';

import {
  StateField,
  StateEffect,
  Transaction,
  Extension
} from '@codemirror/state';

import {
  syntaxTree
} from '@codemirror/language';
```

### Type Definitions
- Define interfaces for edit tracking state
- Create types for decoration management
- Establish transaction monitoring types
- Set up position mapping interfaces

### Plugin Structure
- Create main extension that combines ViewPlugin and StateField
- Establish proper lifecycle management
- Set up integration with Obsidian's editor management
- Create registration mechanism for edit tracking

## Implementation Notes

- Use CodeMirror 6 API exclusively (no legacy v5 code)
- Ensure compatibility with Obsidian's CodeMirror implementation
- Follow Obsidian plugin best practices for editor extensions
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing Track Edits functionality
- Use TypeScript strict mode for type safety

## Testing Strategy

- Verify CodeMirror modules import correctly
- Test plugin registration with Obsidian
- Validate editor instance access
- Confirm type definitions compile without errors
- Test error handling for integration failures

## Dependencies

- Obsidian API
- CodeMirror 6
- TypeScript compiler
- Existing Track Edits plugin structure

## Files to Modify

- `src/main.ts` - Plugin initialization
- `src/codemirror-integration.ts` - New file for CodeMirror setup
- `src/types.ts` - Type definitions
- `package.json` - Dependencies (if needed)

## Success Criteria

The task is complete when:
1. All CodeMirror imports are working without errors
2. Basic plugin structure is established and registering correctly
3. TypeScript compilation succeeds with strict mode
4. Editor instance is accessible from the plugin
5. Foundation is ready for ViewPlugin and StateField implementation

## Notes

This task establishes the foundation for the entire CodeMirror rebuild. All subsequent tasks (002 and 003) depend on the successful completion of this setup phase. Focus on creating a solid, well-typed foundation that can support the edit tracking functionality.
