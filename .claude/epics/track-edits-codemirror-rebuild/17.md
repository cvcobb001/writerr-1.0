### User Documentation Structure
```markdown
# Track Edits User Guide

## Quick Start

Track Edits visualizes your writing changes in real-time, helping you see what you've added, removed, or modified. Perfect for review, revision, and understanding your writing process.

### Installation

1. Open Obsidian Settings
2. Go to Community Plugins
3. Search for "Track Edits"
4. Install and enable the plugin

### Basic Usage

1. **Start Tracking**: Track Edits automatically starts when you open a document
2. **See Changes**: Your edits appear as colored highlights in the editor
   - ðŸŸ¢ Green: New text you've added
   - ðŸ”´ Red: Text you've deleted (with strikethrough)
3. **View Panel**: Open the Track Edits panel to see organized clusters of changes
4. **Accept/Reject**: Use panel controls to accept or reject edit clusters

### Understanding Edit Clusters

Track Edits groups related changes into "clusters" based on:
- **Time**: Edits made within 2 seconds of each other
- **Position**: Changes near each other in the document  
- **Type**: Similar kinds of changes (additions, deletions, replacements)

Example: Changing "quick brown fox" to "fast brown fox" creates one cluster containing the deletion of "quick" and addition of "fast".

### Panel Controls

#### Cluster Actions
- **Accept**: Keeps the changes and removes tracking
- **Reject**: Reverts the changes to original text
- **Split**: Breaks complex clusters into smaller parts

#### AI Analysis (Optional)
- **Toggle**: Enable automatic unclear pattern detection
- **Run Once**: Manually analyze current edits for unclear patterns
- **Sensitivity**: Adjust how strict the AI analysis is

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`: Accept selected cluster
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Backspace`: Reject selected cluster
- `Arrow Keys`: Navigate between clusters
- `Space`: Expand/collapse cluster details

### Tips for Effective Use

1. **Review Mode**: Enable Track Edits when reviewing your writing
2. **Collaboration**: Use before sharing to see what you've changed
3. **Learning**: Watch your editing patterns to improve writing efficiency
4. **AI Insights**: Enable AI analysis to catch unclear or repetitive edits

### Troubleshooting

**Q: Track Edits isn't showing my changes**
A: Make sure the plugin is enabled and you've made actual text changes (not just cursor movement).

**Q: Too many decorations are slowing down my editor**
A: Use the panel to accept clusters you're happy with, or adjust settings to reduce tracking sensitivity.

**Q: AI analysis isn't working**
A: Ensure you have an active AI provider configured in Writerr's AI settings.

### Developer Documentation
```markdown
# Track Edits Developer Guide

## Architecture Overview

Track Edits uses a monolithic architecture with global state management, following patterns proven in Writerr 2.0. The plugin integrates directly with CodeMirror's state management system for reliable performance.

### Core Components

#### 1. Plugin Architecture
```
TrackEditsPlugin (main.ts)
â”œâ”€â”€ Extension Registration
â”œâ”€â”€ Global State Management  
â”œâ”€â”€ Obsidian Integration
â””â”€â”€ View Coordination
```

#### 2. CodeMirror Integration
```
ViewPlugin (edit detection)
â”œâ”€â”€ Transaction Monitoring
â”œâ”€â”€ Change Extraction
â””â”€â”€ Real-time Processing

StateField (decoration management)
â”œâ”€â”€ Decoration Set Management
â”œâ”€â”€ Position Mapping
â””â”€â”€ Lifecycle Coordination
```

#### 3. Data Flow
```
User Edit â†’ Transaction â†’ ViewPlugin â†’ Edit Extraction â†’ 
Clustering â†’ StateField â†’ Decoration Rendering â†’ Panel Update
```

### Key Design Decisions

#### Global State Management
- Single source of truth in `globalState` object
- Direct property access for performance
- Module-level variables for cross-component coordination

#### Monolithic Structure
- All functionality in main.ts (~1600 lines)
- Reduces complexity and import management
- Easier debugging and maintenance

#### CodeMirror-Native Approach
- Direct use of `@codemirror/state` and `@codemirror/view`
- No Obsidian abstraction layer dependencies
- Leverages CodeMirror's position mapping and lifecycle

### API Reference

#### Core Interfaces

```typescript
interface Edit {
  id: string;
  type: 'deletion' | 'insertion';
  position: number;
  length: number;
  oldText?: string;
  newText?: string;
  timestamp: number;
}

interface EditCluster {
  id: string;
  edits: Edit[];
  type: 'deletion' | 'insertion' | 'replacement';
  startPosition: number;
  endPosition: number;
  startTime: number;
  endTime: number;
}
```

### Extension Points

#### Custom Clustering Algorithms
Implement `ClusteringStrategy` interface to add new clustering approaches:

```typescript
interface ClusteringStrategy {
  shouldCluster(edit: Edit, cluster: EditCluster): boolean;
  mergeEdits(edits: Edit[]): EditCluster;
}
```

#### Custom Decorations
Override decoration creation for custom styling:

```typescript
function createCustomDecoration(edit: Edit): Decoration {
  // Custom decoration logic
}
```

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
- Clustering algorithm validation
- Edit detection accuracy
- Decoration lifecycle management

#### Integration Tests  
- CodeMirror extension functionality
- Obsidian plugin lifecycle
- Cross-editor instance behavior

#### Performance Tests
- Large document handling
- High-frequency edit scenarios
- Memory usage profiling

### Building and Development

#### Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run dev  # Start development build with watch
```

#### Testing
```bash
npm test           # Run unit tests
npm run test:perf  # Run performance benchmarks
npm run test:e2e   # Run end-to-end tests
```

#### Release Process
```bash
npm run build      # Production build
npm run package    # Create plugin package
npm run release    # Tag and publish release
```

### Performance Considerations

#### Critical Paths
1. **Edit Detection**: Must complete within 1ms
2. **Decoration Rendering**: Target < 16ms for 60fps
3. **Clustering**: Budget 100ms for recalculation
4. **Panel Updates**: Batch within 100ms window

#### Memory Management
- Automatic cleanup after 1000 edits
- Decoration cache for efficiency
- Weak references for view instances

### Contributing

#### Code Style
- Follow existing patterns in codebase
- Add JSDoc comments for public methods
- Include unit tests for new functionality
- Maintain performance benchmarks

#### Pull Request Process
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Implement with tests and documentation
3. Ensure all benchmarks pass
4. Request review from maintainers
```

### Code Cleanup Tasks
```typescript
// TODO: Remove debug logging before release
console.log('Debug info:', edit); // REMOVE

// TODO: Optimize this loop for large edit sets
for (const edit of allEdits) { // Consider batch processing
  processEdit(edit);
}

// TODO: Add error handling for edge cases
const result = riskyOperation(); // Add try/catch

// TODO: Extract magic numbers to constants
if (timeDiff > 2000) { // Use CLUSTERING_TIME_WINDOW constant
  
// TODO: Simplify complex conditional logic
if (a && b && (c || d) && !e) { // Extract to helper function
```

## Implementation Notes

- Use consistent JSDoc format across all files
- Include code examples in documentation
- Add troubleshooting section for common issues
- Create migration guide for users upgrading from V1
- Document all configuration options and their effects
- Include performance tuning recommendations
- Add accessibility considerations for UI components
- Document known limitations and workarounds

## Testing Strategy

- Validate all example code in documentation
- Test documentation accuracy against actual implementation
- Review code coverage and add tests for uncovered areas
- Verify all configuration options work as documented
- Test edge cases mentioned in troubleshooting guide
- Validate performance claims in documentation
- Test accessibility features function correctly
- Ensure clean installation and removal process

## Dependencies

- All previous tasks (001-009) for complete functionality
- JSDoc tools for documentation generation
- Code coverage tools for test validation
- Style linting tools for consistency

## Files to Modify

- `src/main.ts` - Add comprehensive JSDoc comments
- `README.md` - Update with user guide content
- `docs/` - New directory for detailed documentation
- `docs/user-guide.md` - Complete user documentation
- `docs/developer-guide.md` - Technical documentation
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions
- `docs/changelog.md` - Version history and changes
- All source files - Add inline comments and cleanup

## Success Criteria

The task is complete when:
1. All public methods have comprehensive JSDoc documentation
2. User guide covers all features with clear examples
3. Developer documentation explains architecture and APIs
4. Code cleanup removes all TODO items and improves readability
5. Troubleshooting guide addresses common user issues
6. All test cases pass with good coverage
7. Documentation is accurate and up-to-date
8. Code follows consistent style guidelines throughout

## Notes

Documentation quality directly impacts user adoption and developer contribution. Focus on clear, practical examples rather than comprehensive API listings. The user guide should get someone productive quickly, while the developer guide should enable easy contribution and customization. Code cleanup is essential for maintainability - remove dead code, extract magic numbers, add error handling, and improve naming. This final polish phase determines whether Track Edits feels like a professional, reliable tool or a rough prototype.
