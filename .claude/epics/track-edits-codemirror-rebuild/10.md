## Description

Implement the CodeMirror StateField that manages edit tracking state, handles decoration rendering, and maintains accurate position mapping as the document changes. This StateField will consume edit data from the ViewPlugin and manage the visual representation of tracked changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create StateField for managing edit tracking state
- [x] Implement decoration creation and management
- [x] Handle position mapping for document changes
- [x] Manage edit history and state persistence
- [x] Implement state effects for external state updates
- [x] Add configuration support for decoration styles
- [x] Handle document reloading and state restoration
- [x] Optimize performance for large edit histories

## Technical Requirements

### StateField Structure
```typescript
const editTrackingStateField = StateField.define<EditTrackingState>({
  create(state: EditorState): EditTrackingState {
    // Initialize state
  },

  update(value: EditTrackingState, transaction: Transaction): EditTrackingState {
    // Update state based on transaction
  },

  provide: [
    // Provide decorations
    EditorView.decorations.from(editTrackingStateField, state => state.decorations)
  ]
});
```

### State Management
- Define EditTrackingState interface
- Manage collection of tracked edits
- Handle edit expiration and cleanup
- Maintain decoration mappings
- Track edit metadata and relationships
- Implement state serialization/deserialization

### Decoration Management
- Create decorations for different edit types
- Handle decoration positioning and styling
- Manage decoration lifecycle
- Implement efficient decoration updates
- Support customizable decoration styles
- Handle overlapping decorations

### Position Mapping
- Map edit positions through document changes
- Handle position invalidation
- Maintain accurate position references
- Update decorations after document changes
- Handle complex position transformations
- Optimize mapping performance

### State Effects
```typescript
const addEditEffect = StateEffect.define<EditData>();
const removeEditEffect = StateEffect.define<string>();
const updateConfigEffect = StateEffect.define<EditTrackingConfig>();
```

## Implementation Notes

- Use Transaction.state for accessing current editor state
- Leverage CodeMirror's position mapping utilities
- Implement efficient decoration diffing for updates
- Use proper immutable state updates
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing edit data
- Optimize for memory usage with large edit histories
- Handle edge cases like document reload and undo/redo

## Testing Strategy

- Test state updates with various transaction types
- Verify decoration positioning accuracy
- Test position mapping with document changes
- Validate state persistence and restoration
- Test performance with large edit histories
- Verify integration with ViewPlugin data

## Dependencies

- Task 001 (CodeMirror Integration Setup)
- Task 002 (ViewPlugin Implementation)
- CodeMirror StateField API
- CodeMirror decoration system
- Existing Track Edits configuration

## Files to Modify

- `src/codemirror-state-field.ts` - New file for StateField implementation
- `src/decoration-manager.ts` - New file for decoration logic
- `src/position-mapper.ts` - New file for position mapping
- `src/edit-state.ts` - New file for state definitions
- `src/types.ts` - Add StateField-related types
- `src/main.ts` - Register StateField

## Success Criteria

The task is complete when:
1. StateField manages edit tracking state correctly
2. Decorations render accurately and update properly
3. Position mapping maintains accuracy through document changes
4. State effects work for external state updates
5. Performance is acceptable with large edit histories
6. Integration with ViewPlugin provides seamless edit tracking
7. All visual elements match existing Track Edits appearance

## Notes

This StateField represents the culmination of the CodeMirror rebuild, bringing together all the edit tracking functionality in a performant, maintainable way. It must seamlessly integrate with the ViewPlugin from task 002 while providing the same user experience as the current Track Edits implementation.

Special attention should be paid to performance optimization, as this StateField will be active during all editing operations and needs to handle potentially large edit histories efficiently.
