## Description

Implement the CodeMirror ViewPlugin that monitors editor transactions and extracts edit information. This plugin will be responsible for detecting text changes, capturing edit metadata, and preparing data for the StateField to manage decorations and position tracking.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create ViewPlugin that monitors all editor transactions
- [ ] Implement transaction filtering to identify relevant text changes
- [ ] Extract edit information (position, content, timestamp, type)
- [ ] Handle different types of edits (insert, delete, replace)
- [ ] Implement edit clustering logic for rapid consecutive changes
- [ ] Add transaction validation and error handling
- [ ] Integrate with existing edit tracking data structures
- [ ] Ensure proper memory management for edit history

## Technical Requirements

### ViewPlugin Structure
```typescript
const editTrackingViewPlugin = ViewPlugin.fromClass(class {
  constructor(view: EditorView) {
    // Initialize view plugin
  }

  update(update: ViewUpdate) {
    // Process transactions and extract edits
  }

  destroy() {
    // Cleanup resources
  }
});
```

### Transaction Monitoring
- Monitor all ViewUpdate transactions
- Filter for transactions that contain text changes
- Extract change information from transactions
- Handle multi-step transactions (undo/redo)
- Track cursor position changes
- Identify selection-based operations

### Edit Extraction
- Parse transaction changes into edit objects
- Capture edit metadata:
  - Start/end positions
  - Original text (for deletions)
  - New text (for insertions)
  - Timestamp
  - Edit type classification
- Handle overlapping edits
- Manage edit boundaries

### Edit Clustering
- Group rapid consecutive edits
- Implement time-based clustering (configurable threshold)
- Handle position-based clustering for adjacent changes
- Merge compatible edit operations
- Maintain edit sequence integrity

## Implementation Notes

- Use ViewUpdate.transactions to access all transaction data
- Leverage Transaction.changes for detailed change information
- Implement efficient position mapping for long documents
- Use proper TypeScript typing for all edit data structures
- Maintain compatibility with existing Track Edits data formats
- Optimize for performance with large documents and frequent edits

## Testing Strategy

- Test with various edit scenarios (typing, deletion, replacement)
- Verify edit clustering works correctly
- Test with rapid consecutive edits
- Validate position tracking accuracy
- Test memory usage with long editing sessions
- Verify integration with existing edit tracking

## Dependencies

- Task 001 (CodeMirror Integration Setup)
- CodeMirror ViewPlugin API
- CodeMirror Transaction system
- Existing Track Edits data structures

## Files to Modify

- `src/codemirror-view-plugin.ts` - New file for ViewPlugin implementation
- `src/edit-extractor.ts` - New file for edit extraction logic
- `src/edit-clustering.ts` - New file for edit clustering
- `src/types.ts` - Add ViewPlugin-related types
- `src/main.ts` - Register ViewPlugin

## Success Criteria

The task is complete when:
1. ViewPlugin successfully monitors all editor transactions
2. Edit extraction captures all necessary metadata accurately
3. Edit clustering groups related changes appropriately
4. Performance is acceptable with large documents
5. Integration with existing edit tracking works seamlessly
6. All tests pass with various editing scenarios

## Notes

This ViewPlugin serves as the core monitoring system for the new CodeMirror-based edit tracking. It must be robust and efficient as it processes every editor change. The extracted edit data will be consumed by the StateField in task 003 for decoration management and position tracking.
