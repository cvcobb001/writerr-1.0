# Epic: Writerr

## Overview

Writerr is a comprehensive AI editorial platform built as an Obsidian plugin suite comprising three sophisticated, interconnected components:

**üîß Track Edits Plugin** - Universal change management system with intelligent clustering, batch processing, confidence thresholds, and advanced visual diffs for granular control over all text modifications.

**üí¨ Writerr Chat Plugin** - Sophisticated conversational AI interface with dynamic mode switching, unlimited customization through /Modes folder architecture, and deep document intelligence.

**‚öôÔ∏è AI Editorial Functions Plugin** - Dynamic function registry that hot-loads editorial behaviors from user-editable .md/.xml files, enabling unlimited specialized AI editors with constraint enforcement and session management.

The system transforms AI writing assistance from a one-size-fits-all tool into a personalized editorial team. Writers maintain complete control through the HUD philosophy while having access to unlimited customization possibilities for any writing scenario, genre, or editorial need.
