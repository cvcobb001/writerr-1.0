# Task 004: AI Editorial Functions Plugin

## Overview
Build the dynamic function registry that hot-loads editorial behaviors from user-editable .md/.xml files, enabling unlimited specialized AI editors with constraint enforcement, session learning, and sophisticated validation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dynamic function loading from .md/.xml files with hot-reload capability
- [ ] Function definition parser with comprehensive validation
- [ ] Default function library: Copy Editor, Proofreader, Developmental Editor, Co-Writer
- [ ] Custom function creation system with templates and examples
- [ ] Constraint enforcement engine for forbidden phrases and actions
- [ ] Session learning system with user feedback integration
- [ ] JSON schema validation for function outputs
- [ ] Sandboxed execution environment for user-defined functions
- [ ] Function prioritization and selection system
- [ ] Track Edits integration with per-function configuration
- [ ] Performance monitoring and resource management
- [ ] Error recovery and function validation framework

## Technical Requirements

### Function Registry Core
- File system monitoring for .md/.xml changes
- Hot-reload without breaking active editorial sessions
- Function lifecycle management (load, validate, execute, unload)
- Version control and rollback capabilities
- Function dependency resolution

### Definition Parsing System
- Robust markdown parser with YAML frontmatter support
- XML parser for advanced function definitions
- Comprehensive validation with user-friendly error messages
- Schema validation for all function metadata
- Template generation for new function creation

### Default Function Library
- **Copy Editor**: Light touch improvements for flow, clarity, style
- **Proofreader**: Grammar, spelling, punctuation corrections
- **Developmental Editor**: Structure, organization, argument analysis
- **Co-Writer**: Content generation and expansion assistance

### Constraint Enforcement
- Automatic detection of forbidden phrases/actions
- Output validation against defined schemas
- Quality scoring and confidence measurement
- Behavioral constraint monitoring
- Safety checks for user-generated functions

### Session Learning System
- User feedback pattern recognition
- Function behavior adaptation over time
- Drift detection and correction
- Reinforcement learning integration
- Performance optimization based on usage

### Execution Environment
- Secure sandbox for function execution
- Resource allocation and monitoring
- Timeout handling and recovery
- Memory management and cleanup
- Error isolation and reporting

### Track Edits Integration
- Per-function batching configuration
- Clustering strategy customization
- Confidence threshold settings
- Change categorization mapping
- Review requirement specification

## Dependencies
- Foundation Infrastructure (Task 001)
- Track Edits Plugin (Task 002)
- AI Providers Plugin (existing)
- File system monitoring APIs
- JSON schema validation libraries

## Integration Points
- All function outputs route through Track Edits
- Functions use AI Providers for AI model access
- Integration with Writerr Chat mode system

## Estimated Effort
**70 hours (9 days)**

## Risks
- Hot-reload system stability
- User-created function quality and safety
- Complex constraint enforcement
- Performance with many active functions
- Memory management during function execution

## Success Metrics
- Function loading success rate >98%
- Hot-reload applies changes in <200ms
- Support 100+ custom functions simultaneously
- Zero security breaches from user-defined functions
- Function execution completes in <5 seconds
- Memory usage scales linearly with active functions
- User can create working custom function within 30 minutes
