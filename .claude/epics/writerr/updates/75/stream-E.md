#### Vulnerability Scanning System
- [x] Developed comprehensive `VulnerabilityScanner` with 20+ scan rules
- [x] Implemented detection for code injection, XSS, command injection, path traversal
- [x] Added sensitive data exposure detection and weak cryptography identification
- [x] Created dependency vulnerability scanning with known CVE database
- [x] Implemented configuration security validation for JSON and YAML files
- [x] Added auto-fix capability for certain vulnerability types
