# Writerr 1.0 Development Guidelines

Always use:
- Serena for semantic code retrieval and editing tools
- context7 for up to date documentation on third party code (when available)
- sequential thinking for any decision making (when available)
- Be concise - no unnecessary explanations  
- Show code, not lengthy descriptions
- Only read what's needed for the specific task

Read this claude.md file before you do anything.

#$ARGUMENTS

## Project Context

**Writerr Platform** is a professional AI editorial suite for Obsidian that provides writers complete, granular control over AI-assisted editing through a constraint-based processing architecture. The platform consists of three tightly integrated plugins that work together as a unified writing environment while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

### Core Innovation
**Editorial Engine Plugin** - A neutral constraint processing system that compiles natural language editing preferences into programmatic rulesets, providing enterprise-grade AI behavior control and routing capabilities.

### Platform Vision
Transform Obsidian into the professional AI writing platform by providing infrastructure that any plugin can use for sophisticated AI constraint management, while delivering a seamless user experience that feels like a single, cohesive application.

## Workflow Instructions

1. Use Serena to understand existing code patterns in the project
2. When making changes, follow the established architecture patterns
3. Before implementing complex features, think through the approach step by step
4. Maintain clean separation between the three plugins
5. Use the platform integration layer for cross-plugin communication
