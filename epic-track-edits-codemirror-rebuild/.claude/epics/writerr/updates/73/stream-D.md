# Stream D Progress: Core Chat Modes Implementation

## Overview
Implementing the four core modes (Chat, Copy Edit, Proofread, Writing Assistant) with mode-specific behavior, prompt engineering, validation, and context preservation.

## Progress

### Phase 1: Initial Setup ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Read full task specification
- [x] Examined existing mode system infrastructure
- [x] Created progress tracking file
- [x] Create modes directory structure
- [x] Create builtin directory structure

### Phase 2: Core Mode Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Chat Mode (pure conversation, no edits)
- [x] Copy Edit Mode (structural/style improvements)
- [x] Proofread Mode (grammar/mechanics corrections)
- [x] Writing Assistant Mode (creative collaboration)

### Phase 3: Mode-Specific Features ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement mode-specific prompt engineering
- [x] Add default mode templates and examples
- [x] Create mode validation and error handling
- [x] Implement mode switching logic with context preservation

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create comprehensive mode validation system
- [x] Implement context preservation for seamless mode switching
- [x] Build advanced prompt engineering with mode-specific optimization
- [x] Add extensive documentation and examples

## Key Deliverables Status ✅ ALL COMPLETED
- [x] Four core modes fully implemented
- [x] Mode-specific behavior and optimized prompts
- [x] Default templates for user customization
- [x] Comprehensive validation and error handling
- [x] Context preservation for mode switching
- [x] Examples and documentation

## Technical Notes
- Building on Stream A's mode system infrastructure
- Using .md files with YAML frontmatter in /modes/ directory
- Parser supports template variables: {{document}}, {{selection}}, {{userInput}}
- Editing modes integrate with Track Edits system

## Implementation Summary

### Core Mode Files Created
- `/modes/chat.md` - Pure conversational assistant with comprehensive examples
- `/modes/copy-edit.md` - Professional editing with Track Edits integration
- `/modes/proofread.md` - Grammar/spelling corrections with error categorization
- `/modes/writing-assistant.md` - Creative collaboration with content generation

### Built-in Infrastructure
- `CoreModeValidator.ts` - Comprehensive validation system for all four core modes
- `ContextPreservation.ts` - Seamless mode switching with intelligent context preservation
- `PromptEngineering.ts` - Advanced prompt optimization with mode-specific templates
- `index.ts` - Export interface and utility functions

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Mode-Specific Behavior**: Each mode has optimized prompts, temperature settings, and validation rules
2. **Track Edits Integration**: Editing modes properly configured for different edit types (style, grammar, creative)
3. **Context Preservation**: Intelligent session continuity when switching between modes
4. **Advanced Validation**: Comprehensive error checking and suggestions for mode configurations
5. **Smart Prompt Engineering**: Context-aware prompt optimization with token management

### Ready for Integration
All core modes are ready for integration with Stream A's infrastructure. The system supports:
- Hot-reload of mode definitions
- Validation of custom user modes
- Mode transition recommendations
- Context-aware prompt optimization
- Session continuity across mode switches

## Stream D Status: ✅ COMPLETED
