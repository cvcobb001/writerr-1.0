# Task 001: Foundation Infrastructure

## Overview
Build the core infrastructure that enables all three Writerr plugins to communicate and work together seamlessly. This includes the global event bus, shared type system, plugin registry, and build system architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Global Event Bus implemented with type-safe inter-plugin communication
- [ ] Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces defined for all shared data structures
- [ ] Plugin Registry system for capability discovery and registration
- [ ] Mono-repo build system configured for three plugins
- [ ] Basic integration testing framework established
- [ ] Shared utilities and helper functions created
- [ ] Error handling framework consistent across all components

## Technical Requirements

### Global Event Bus
- Type-safe event emission and listening
- Guaranteed message delivery with retry logic
- Event filtering and routing capabilities
- Performance monitoring for message throughput
- Memory leak prevention with proper cleanup

### Shared Type System
- Complete TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Change tracking types (Change, ChangeCluster, ChangeSource)
- Chat mode and function definition types
- Configuration and settings types
- Error and validation types
- API contract types between plugins

### Plugin Registry
- Dynamic plugin capability registration
- Service discovery and dependency resolution
- Version compatibility checking
- Plugin lifecycle management
- API exposure management

### Build System
- TypeScript compilation for all three plugins
- Hot reload during development
- Production bundling and optimization
- Asset management for shared resources
- Testing pipeline integration

## Dependencies
- Obsidian Plugin API
- TypeScript 5.0+
- Build tools (Rollup/Webpack)
- Testing framework setup

## Estimated Effort
**52 hours (6.5 days)**

## Risks
- Complex inter-plugin communication patterns
- TypeScript compilation complexity
- Performance overhead from event system

## Success Metrics
- All plugins can communicate through event bus
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- Build time under 30 seconds
- Hot reload working reliably
