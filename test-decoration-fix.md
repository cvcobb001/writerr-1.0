# Track Edits Decoration Test

## Testing Plan

1. **Load the plugin** in Obsidian development vault
2. **Start tracking** (using ribbon icon or command)
3. **Type some text** to trigger change detection
4. **Check console logs** for decoration creation messages
5. **Look for visual decorations** in the editor

## Expected Behavior

When typing, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Console log: "Editor change detected"
- ‚úÖ Console log: "Recording X changes"  
- ‚úÖ Console log: "Showing decorations for X changes"
- ‚úÖ Console log: "Creating decoration with class..."
- ‚úÖ Console log: "Applied CodeMirror decorations..."
- üîç **NEW**: Visual decorations around recent edits (green border/highlight)
- üîç **NEW**: Temporary notification bubbles on the right side

## Debugging Steps

If decorations still don't appear:

1. Check console for "No decorated elements found" warning
2. Verify CodeMirror extension is registered
3. Check if CSS classes are being applied correctly
4. Ensure positioning calculations are accurate

## What Was Fixed

1. **CodeMirror Integration**: Added proper extension registration
2. **Decoration Application**: Fixed dispatch mechanism  
3. **CSS Enhancement**: Made decorations more visible with borders and animations
4. **Position Calculation**: Improved document position calculation
5. **Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging to trace decoration lifecycle

## Manual Test
