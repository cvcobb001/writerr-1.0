## Key Technical Innovations

### 1. AI-Native Change Attribution
Enhanced the EditChange interface to capture complete AI processing context:
```typescript
interface EnhancedEditChange extends EditChange {
  aiProvider?: string;      // e.g., "claude-3", "gpt-4"
  aiModel?: string;         // e.g., "claude-3-opus"
  processingContext?: {     // Editorial Engine context
    mode?: string;
    constraints?: string[];
    instructions?: string;
  };
  aiTimestamp?: Date;       // AI processing timestamp
}
```

### 2. Platform Event Bus Architecture
Integrated with window.Writerr event system for real-time coordination:
```typescript
// Event broadcasting for cross-plugin coordination
await window.Writerr.eventBus.publish('track-edits:changes-recorded', {
  sessionId,
  changes: aiChanges,
  provider: 'editorial-engine',
  metadata: processingContext
});
```

### 3. Semantic Batch Processing
Intelligent change grouping based on content relationships:
```typescript
// Groups related changes by semantic scope
const batches = await batchProcessor.groupChangesBySemantic(changes, {
  scope: 'paragraph',    // or 'sentence', 'section', 'chapter'
  timeout: 2000,         // Wait 2s for related changes
  maxBatchSize: 50       // Prevent overwhelming batches
});
```
