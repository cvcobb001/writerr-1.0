# Product Mission (Lite)

**Writing HUD is the first AI-powered writing tool that enhances rather than replaces the writer's creative process.** Like a pilot's heads-up display, Writing HUD provides ambient awareness and contextual assistance without interrupting creative flow or taking control away from writers.

Writing HUD serves creative writers, professional writers, and academic researchers who want enhanced perception of their writing process with complete transparency and control. Unlike traditional AI tools that act as "copilots" breaking flow with intrusive suggestions, Writing HUD provides silent but available information - showing patterns and insights in your work while keeping you in complete creative control through granular change tracking and source attribution.
