## Tasks

### Phase 0: Current Implementation Audit (CRITICAL FIRST STEP)
- [ ] **Analyze Existing Chat UI Deviations from Obsidian Standards**
  - Document all visual deviations (border radius values, custom spacing patterns, hardcoded colors)
  - Document functional deviations (auto-resize textarea, custom keyboard shortcuts, hover implementations)
  - Analyze component-specific deviations (ChatInput, MessageBubble, ContextArea, ChatHeader, Tooltips)
  - Create decision framework for each deviation: ‚úÖ CONFORM / ü§î EVALUATE / ‚ùå PRESERVE
  - Generate comprehensive audit report with recommendations before any implementation begins

### Phase 1: Design System Foundation
- [ ] **Extract BaseComponent Architecture**
  - Create shared BaseComponent class with createElement(), hover effects, tooltip system
  - Document component lifecycle patterns and extension guidelines
  - Establish TypeScript interfaces for consistent component options

- [ ] **Standardize CSS-in-JS Patterns**
  - Document template literal styling approaches with Obsidian CSS variables
  - Create style utility functions for common patterns (hover effects, focus states)
  - Establish naming conventions for component-specific CSS classes

- [ ] **Centralize Icon System**
  - Extract Lucide icon integration patterns from existing implementation
  - Document icon size presets and stroke width standards
  - Create icon factory methods for common usage scenarios

### Phase 2: Component Library Documentation
- [ ] **Button Component Standards**
  - Document toolbar button patterns with consistent sizing and states
  - Extract send button styling with loading, disabled, and active states
  - Standardize action button patterns for message interactions

- [ ] **Input Component Guidelines**
  - Document chat input patterns with auto-resize and validation states
  - Extract dropdown button styling for model/prompt selectors
  - Establish form control consistency across different input types

- [ ] **Layout Pattern Library**
  - Document message bubble structures with role-based styling differences
  - Extract toolbar layout patterns with proper spacing and alignment
  - Standardize container structures and responsive behavior patterns

### Phase 3: Animation and Interaction Standards
- [ ] **Animation Framework**
  - Document 0.2s ease transition timing standards
  - Extract loading animation patterns (spin keyframes, state management)
  - Establish hover effect guidelines (scale transformations, color changes)

- [ ] **Tooltip System Integration**
  - Extract universal tooltip implementation with consistent delay timing
  - Document tooltip positioning and styling using Obsidian theme colors
  - Establish accessibility guidelines for tooltip content and behavior

- [ ] **State Management Patterns**
  - Document hover state preservation techniques during temporary changes
  - Extract focus indicator standards for accessibility compliance
  - Standardize disabled state visual feedback across component types

### Phase 4: Implementation Examples
- [ ] **Code Sample Library**
  - Create working examples of each major component pattern
  - Document integration patterns with existing Obsidian plugin architecture
  - Provide migration examples for converting existing components

- [ ] **Style Guide Documentation**
  - Document spacing system with standard padding, margin, and gap values
  - Extract color usage patterns with proper Obsidian CSS variable references
  - Create typography guidelines for text sizing and font family usage

- [ ] **Testing and Validation**
  - Create component pattern validation checklist
  - Document browser compatibility requirements for CSS features
  - Establish design system compliance review process for new components
