# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-28-writerr-platform-design-system/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-28
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

### Phase 0: Current Implementation Audit (CRITICAL FIRST STEP)
- [x] **Analyze Existing Chat UI Deviations from Obsidian Standards**
  - Document all visual deviations (border radius values, custom spacing patterns, hardcoded colors)
  - Document functional deviations (auto-resize textarea, custom keyboard shortcuts, hover implementations)
  - Analyze component-specific deviations (ChatInput, MessageBubble, ContextArea, ChatHeader, Tooltips)
  - Create decision framework for each deviation: ‚úÖ CONFORM / ü§î EVALUATE / ‚ùå PRESERVE
  - Generate comprehensive audit report with recommendations before any implementation begins

### Phase 1: Design System Foundation
- [x] **Extract BaseComponent Architecture**
  - Create shared BaseComponent class with createElement(), hover effects, tooltip system
  - Document component lifecycle patterns and extension guidelines
  - Establish TypeScript interfaces for consistent component options

- [x] **Standardize CSS-in-JS Patterns**
  - Document template literal styling approaches with Obsidian CSS variables
  - Create style utility functions for common patterns (hover effects, focus states)
  - Establish naming conventions for component-specific CSS classes

- [x] **Centralize Icon System**
  - Extract Lucide icon integration patterns from existing implementation
  - Document icon size presets and stroke width standards
  - Create icon factory methods for common usage scenarios

### Phase 2: Component Library Documentation
- [x] **Button Component Standards**
  - Document toolbar button patterns with consistent sizing and states
  - Extract send button styling with loading, disabled, and active states
  - Standardize action button patterns for message interactions

- [x] **Input Component Guidelines**
  - Document chat input patterns with auto-resize and validation states
  - Extract dropdown button styling for model/prompt selectors
  - Establish form control consistency across different input types

- [x] **Layout Pattern Library**
  - Document message bubble structures with role-based styling differences
  - Extract toolbar layout patterns with proper spacing and alignment
  - Standardize container structures and responsive behavior patterns

### Phase 3: Animation and Interaction Standards
- [x] **Animation Framework**
  - Document 0.2s ease transition timing standards
  - Extract loading animation patterns (spin keyframes, state management)
  - Establish hover effect guidelines (scale transformations, color changes)

- [x] **Tooltip System Integration**
  - Extract universal tooltip implementation with consistent delay timing
  - Document tooltip positioning and styling using Obsidian theme colors
  - Establish accessibility guidelines for tooltip content and behavior

- [x] **State Management Patterns**
  - Document hover state preservation techniques during temporary changes
  - Extract focus indicator standards for accessibility compliance
  - Standardize disabled state visual feedback across component types

### Phase 4: Implementation Examples
- [x] **Code Sample Library**
  - Create working examples of each major component pattern
  - Document integration patterns with existing Obsidian plugin architecture
  - Provide migration examples for converting existing components

- [x] **Style Guide Documentation**
  - Document spacing system with standard padding, margin, and gap values
  - Extract color usage patterns with proper Obsidian CSS variable references
  - Create typography guidelines for text sizing and font family usage

- [x] **Testing and Validation**
  - Create component pattern validation checklist
  - Document browser compatibility requirements for CSS features
  - Establish design system compliance review process for new components

## Status: COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Final Deliverable:** `/Users/chriscobb/Documents/AI-HUD/Writerr 1.0/.agent-os/specs/2025-08-28-writerr-platform-design-system/testing-validation.md`

All four phases of the Writerr Platform Design System specification have been completed:

### Phase 0: ‚úÖ Current Implementation Audit
- Comprehensive deviation audit report created
- Decision framework established for all deviations
- Foundation for design system compliance established

### Phase 1: ‚úÖ Design System Foundation  
- BaseComponent architecture extracted and documented
- CSS-in-JS patterns standardized
- Icon system centralized

### Phase 2: ‚úÖ Component Library Documentation
- Button component standards documented
- Input component guidelines established  
- Layout pattern library created

### Phase 3: ‚úÖ Animation and Interaction Standards
- Animation framework documented
- Tooltip system integration established
- State management patterns standardized

### Phase 4: ‚úÖ Implementation Examples
- Code sample library created
- Style guide documentation completed
- **Testing and validation guidelines established** (FINAL TASK)

The Writerr Platform Design System is now fully documented and ready for implementation across all three plugins in the platform architecture.
