# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: writerr-platform-design-system
> Created: 2025-08-28
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Extract and document the comprehensive UI/UX design system from the Writerr Chat plugin to establish consistent visual standards, interaction patterns, and component architecture across all Writerr platform plugins. This specification will serve as the foundation for maintaining visual cohesion and providing reusable design patterns as the platform expands.

## User Stories

**As a plugin developer**, I want a comprehensive design system so I can build components that integrate seamlessly with the existing Writerr interface without reinventing styling patterns.

**As a user**, I want a consistent visual experience across all Writerr plugins so the integrated suite feels like a cohesive professional application rather than separate tools.

**As a platform maintainer**, I want documented design standards so new features maintain visual consistency and accessibility standards across the entire ecosystem.

**As a designer**, I want a systematic approach to component styling so I can extend the design language predictably while maintaining brand coherence.

## Spec Scope

### Core Design System Components
- **BaseComponent Architecture**: Foundation class with createElement(), hover effects, tooltip system
- **CSS-in-JS Patterns**: Template literal styling with Obsidian CSS variables integration
- **Input System**: Standardized form controls with focus states, borders, and validation styling
- **Button System**: Ghost-style buttons with consistent hover/active/loading patterns
- **Icon Integration**: Lucide icon system with size presets and stroke standardization
- **Animation Standards**: Transition timing, loading animations, and hover effects
- **Typography**: Text sizing, color usage, and font family patterns
- **Spacing System**: Consistent padding, margins, and gap measurements
- **Color System**: Obsidian CSS variable usage and theme integration
- **Layout Patterns**: Flexbox arrangements, container structures, and responsive behavior

### Component Library Documentation
- Message bubbles with role-based styling and markdown rendering
- Chat input with auto-resize and validation states
- Toolbar with dropdown menus and token counter
- Context areas with document management
- Header components with mode selection
- Action buttons with unified tooltip system

### Interaction Patterns
- Hover state management and visual feedback
- Focus indicator standards for accessibility
- Loading state animations and user feedback
- Dropdown menu behavior and positioning
- Tooltip delay timing and content formatting

## Out of Scope

- Plugin-specific business logic or data handling
- Backend API integration patterns
- Advanced animation libraries or custom CSS frameworks
- Non-visual component behaviors (event handling specifics)
- Obsidian core UI modifications or theme development
- Performance optimization strategies beyond CSS best practices

## Expected Deliverable

A complete design system specification including:

1. **Component Architecture Guide** - BaseComponent usage patterns and extension guidelines
2. **Style Standards Document** - CSS-in-JS patterns, color usage, and spacing rules
3. **Component Library Reference** - Documented examples of all major UI components
4. **Icon System Documentation** - Lucide integration patterns and size standards
5. **Implementation Examples** - Code samples showing proper usage of each pattern
6. **Accessibility Guidelines** - Focus management, tooltip usage, and color contrast standards
