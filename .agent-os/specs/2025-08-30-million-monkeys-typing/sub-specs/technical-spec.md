# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-30-million-monkeys-typing/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- **Text Diff Algorithm**: Implement character-level or word-level diff between original and AI-processed text to identify specific changes
- **Sequential Editor API Usage**: Use Obsidian's Editor API to apply changes sequentially (editor.replaceRange()) rather than Track Edits API calls  
- **Timing Configuration**: Implement configurable delays (1-10ms) between individual text operations with default of 5ms
- **Change Detection Integration**: Ensure compatibility with Track Edits' existing CodeMirror ViewPlugin change detection system
- **Performance Monitoring**: Total application time must remain under 100ms for documents up to 10KB
- **Word Boundary Respect**: Implement intelligent chunking that avoids breaking changes mid-word unless necessary
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to current API approach if sequential application fails
- **Configuration Options**: Expose timing and granularity settings through Editorial Engine configuration

## Implementation Details

- **Entry Point**: Modify Editorial Engine's `integrateWithTrackEdits()` method in Chat plugin  
- **Core Function**: Create `simulateHumanEditing(originalText, aiText, editor, options)` function
- **Integration**: Replace `trackEditsAPI.applyChange()` calls with direct document editing
- **Testing**: Verify Track Edits detects each change as separate decoration
- **Compatibility**: Maintain existing Editorial Engine constraint processing workflow
