# Spec Tasks

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Implement Sequential Text Application Core
  - [ ] 1.1 Write tests for text diff calculation and sequential change detection
  - [ ] 1.2 Create `simulateHumanEditing()` function with configurable timing
  - [ ] 1.3 Implement character-level and word-level diff algorithm
  - [ ] 1.4 Add intelligent word boundary detection and chunking logic
  - [ ] 1.5 Integrate performance monitoring to ensure < 100ms execution
  - [ ] 1.6 Verify all tests pass for sequential text application

- [ ] 2. Modify Editorial Engine Integration
  - [ ] 2.1 Write tests for Editorial Engine → document editing pipeline
  - [ ] 2.2 Replace `trackEditsAPI.applyChange()` calls with direct document editing
  - [ ] 2.3 Update `integrateWithTrackEdits()` method to use sequential application
  - [ ] 2.4 Add configuration options for timing and granularity settings
  - [ ] 2.5 Implement graceful fallback to current API approach if sequential fails
  - [ ] 2.6 Verify all tests pass for Editorial Engine integration

- [ ] 3. Validate Track Edits Change Detection
  - [ ] 3.1 Write tests to verify Track Edits detects sequential changes as separate decorations
  - [ ] 3.2 Test timing configurations (1ms, 5ms, 10ms delays) for optimal detection
  - [ ] 3.3 Validate granular decorations appear for different change types (spelling, grammar, style)
  - [ ] 3.4 Test with various document sizes to ensure consistent detection
  - [ ] 3.5 Verify writer can accept/reject individual changes through Track Edits interface
  - [ ] 3.6 Verify all tests pass for change detection validation

- [ ] 4. End-to-End Pipeline Testing
  - [ ] 4.1 Write tests for complete Chat → Editorial Engine → Track Edits workflow
  - [ ] 4.2 Test proofreader mode with sequential editing generates granular decorations
  - [ ] 4.3 Test copy editor mode produces reviewable individual changes
  - [ ] 4.4 Validate performance remains under 100ms for typical documents
  - [ ] 4.5 Test error handling and fallback scenarios
  - [ ] 4.6 Verify all tests pass for end-to-end pipeline functionality
