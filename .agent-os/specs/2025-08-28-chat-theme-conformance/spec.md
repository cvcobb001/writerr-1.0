# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Chat Theme Conformance
> Created: 2025-08-28
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Update Writerr Chat plugin to fully conform to Obsidian themes by replacing all hardcoded values with CSS variables from our design system. This comprehensive theme conformance effort will ensure the chat interface seamlessly integrates with any Obsidian theme while maintaining the HUD approach (silent but available) and preserving all existing functionality and user experience.

## User Stories

1. **Theme Consistency**: As a user with a dark theme, I want the chat interface to seamlessly match my theme without visual jarring or inconsistent elements

2. **Community Theme Support**: As a user of popular themes like Minimal or Things, I want the chat interface to respect theme typography, colors, and spacing conventions  

3. **Visual Integration**: As a writer focused on creative flow, I want the chat interface to feel native to Obsidian rather than like a foreign plugin

## Spec Scope

1. **Font System Conformance** - Replace hardcoded fonts with var(--font-interface), var(--font-text-size)
2. **Color Harmony Implementation** - Update all hardcoded colors to use Obsidian CSS variables
3. **Spacing System Integration** - Apply consistent spacing using theme-aware variables
4. **Component-Wide Updates** - Systematic update of ChatInput, MessageBubble, ContextArea, ChatHeader, etc.
5. **Cross-Theme Testing** - Verify compatibility with light/dark and popular community themes

## Out of Scope

- Functional changes to chat behavior
- New features or UI restructuring  
- Performance optimizations
- Breaking changes to existing API

## Expected Deliverable

A fully theme-conformant Writerr Chat plugin that seamlessly integrates with any Obsidian theme through proper CSS variable usage, maintaining the existing HUD philosophy and user experience while ensuring native visual integration across all components.
