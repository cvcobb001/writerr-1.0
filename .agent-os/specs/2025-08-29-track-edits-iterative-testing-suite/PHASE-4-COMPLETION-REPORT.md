## Real-World Impact

### Before Phase 4
```
Manual Testing Cycle:
1. Run Obsidian with Track Edits plugin
2. Manually test "Go ahead and add that to document" 
3. Observe that changes don't appear in Track Edits
4. Check console logs manually
5. Try to reproduce Editorial Engine errors
6. Document findings in natural language
7. Repeat for each integration point
8. Copy-paste console logs into reports
```

### After Phase 4  
```
Automated Testing Cycle:
1. Run: npm run test-editorial-engine-integration
2. Receive comprehensive HTML report with:
   - Editorial Engine integration health score
   - Chat workflow completion rates
   - AI attribution accuracy metrics
   - Real-world scenario validation results
   - Specific recommendations for fixes
3. HUD auto-fixes infrastructure issues
4. User focuses only on UX/visual problems
```

### Key Improvements
- **Detection Speed**: Real-time vs. manual discovery
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive vs. spot-checking  
- **Accuracy**: Automated correlation vs. human observation
- **Actionability**: Specific recommendations vs. general issues
- **Partnership**: Clear HUD vs. User responsibility separation
