# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-28-track-edits-platform-integration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-28
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

### 1. Enhanced Change Attribution System

**Objective:** Expand the existing EditChange interface and attribution system to capture AI metadata and enable platform-wide change tracking.

- [x] 1.1 Write comprehensive tests for enhanced EditChange interface with AI metadata fields
- [x] 1.2 Extend EditChange interface to include aiProvider, aiModel, processingContext, and timestamp fields
- [ ] 1.3 Update ChangeTracker class to capture and store AI metadata during change recording
- [ ] 1.4 Add backward compatibility layer for existing EditChange objects without AI metadata
- [x] 1.5 Implement metadata validation and sanitization for AI attribution data
- [x] 1.6 Create utility methods for querying changes by AI provider or processing context
- [x] 1.7 Update change persistence to handle expanded metadata schema
- [ ] 1.8 Verify all tests pass and maintain backward compatibility

### 2. Editorial Engine Integration API

**Objective:** Create dedicated API methods for the Editorial Engine to submit AI-generated changes with full attribution and context.

- [ ] 2.1 Write tests for submitChangesFromAI() method with various change scenarios
- [x] 2.2 Implement submitChangesFromAI() method in TrackEditsPlugin class
- [ ] 2.3 Add validation for AI-specific parameters (provider, model, constraints applied)
- [ ] 2.4 Create change grouping logic for batched Editorial Engine submissions
- [ ] 2.5 Implement error handling and rollback capabilities for failed AI submissions
- [ ] 2.6 Add plugin registration system for AI processing plugins
- [ ] 2.7 Create documentation for Editorial Engine integration patterns
- [ ] 2.8 Verify all tests pass and API works with Editorial Engine mock

### 3. Platform Event Bus Integration

**Objective:** Connect Track Edits to the window.Writerr event bus system for real-time cross-plugin coordination and change notifications.

- [ ] 3.1 Write tests for event bus subscription and publication mechanisms
- [ ] 3.2 Implement event bus subscription in TrackEditsPlugin initialization
- [ ] 3.3 Create standardized change event schema for platform-wide broadcasting
- [ ] 3.4 Add event handlers for AI processing start/complete notifications
- [ ] 3.5 Implement change consolidation logic for simultaneous multi-plugin edits
- [ ] 3.6 Create event filtering system to prevent feedback loops between plugins
- [ ] 3.7 Add event persistence for offline change synchronization
- [ ] 3.8 Verify all tests pass and events properly coordinate across plugins

### 4. Context-Aware Batch Processing

**Objective:** Implement intelligent change grouping and semantic batch processing to improve user experience with AI-generated edits.

- [ ] 4.1 Write tests for semantic change grouping algorithms and batch processing logic
- [ ] 4.2 Implement semantic similarity detection for related changes
- [ ] 4.3 Create batch processing queue with configurable grouping timeouts
- [ ] 4.4 Add user preference controls for batch processing behavior
- [ ] 4.5 Implement smart change consolidation to reduce notification noise
- [ ] 4.6 Create visual indicators for batch processing status in UI
- [ ] 4.7 Add batch undo/redo capabilities for grouped changes
- [ ] 4.8 Verify all tests pass and batch processing improves user workflow

### 5. Chat Context Integration

**Objective:** Link Track Edits with Writerr Chat conversations to provide complete context for AI-assisted editing sessions.

- [ ] 5.1 Write tests for conversation linking and chat context association
- [ ] 5.2 Implement conversationId tracking in EditChange objects
- [ ] 5.3 Create API methods for linking changes to chat conversations
- [ ] 5.4 Add chat context retrieval for change history analysis
- [ ] 5.5 Implement conversation-based change filtering and search
- [ ] 5.6 Create UI components to display chat context in change history
- [ ] 5.7 Add conversation timeline view showing chat messages and resulting edits
- [ ] 5.8 Verify all tests pass and chat integration provides meaningful context

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Dependencies
- Task 1 (Attribution System) must be completed before Tasks 2-5
- Task 2 (Editorial Engine API) is prerequisite for optimal Task 4 (Batch Processing)
- Task 3 (Event Bus) enables coordination features in Tasks 4-5
- Tasks 4-5 can be developed in parallel after core infrastructure is complete

### Testing Strategy
- Follow TDD approach: write tests first, implement functionality, verify tests pass
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage for all new API methods
- Include integration tests between Track Edits and mock Editorial Engine
- Test backward compatibility with existing Track Edits installations

### Rollout Approach
- Build incrementally with each task representing a deployable milestone
- Maintain backward compatibility throughout implementation
- Enable feature flags for new integrations to allow gradual rollout
- Document migration path for existing users
