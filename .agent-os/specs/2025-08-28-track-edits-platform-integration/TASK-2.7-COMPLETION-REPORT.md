## Key Integration Patterns Documented

### 1. Plugin Registration Pattern
```typescript
// Complete registration workflow
const registrationResult = await PluginRegistrationHelper.registerWithTrackEdits(
  obsidianPlugin,
  aiProcessingPlugin
);
```

### 2. AI Change Submission Pattern
```typescript
// Comprehensive change submission with error handling
const result = await trackEditsAPI.submitChangesFromAI(
  changes,
  'editorial-engine',
  'claude-3-opus',
  processingContext,
  {
    groupChanges: true,
    editorialEngineMode: true,
    pluginAuthContext: authContext
  }
);
```

### 3. Error Recovery Pattern
```typescript
// Multi-level error recovery with rollback
try {
  const result = await performAIOperation();
} catch (error) {
  const recovery = await errorManager.handleError(error, context);
  if (recovery.rollbackRequired) {
    await performRollback(transactionId);
  }
}
```

### 4. Security Validation Pattern
```typescript
// Comprehensive security validation
const securityResult = await securityValidator.validateSecurity(plugin, options);
if (!securityResult.isSecure) {
  // Handle security violations
}
```
