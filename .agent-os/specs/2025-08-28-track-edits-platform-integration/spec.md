> Spec: Track Edits Platform Integration
> Created: 2025-08-28
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Upgrade the Track Edits plugin to support platform integration with the Editorial Engine and Writerr Chat plugins. This integration transforms Track Edits from a standalone change tracking system into a core component of the Writerr Platform's constraint-based processing architecture, maintaining the HUD philosophy of silent but available, enhanced perception, and granular control.

The integration prioritizes Editorial Engine connection first (core processing pipeline), followed by Chat UI layer integration. The enhanced system will provide context-aware batching that groups changes by semantic relationships rather than arbitrary limits, comprehensive metadata attribution, and seamless integration with the platform's event bus system.

## User Stories

**US-1: Editorial Engine Integration**
As a writer using Editorial Engine modes, I want changes to flow through Track Edits so I can see and approve/reject each AI modification with clear attribution to the specific constraint processing that generated them.

**US-2: Context-Aware Batching** 
As a user processing chapter-level edits, I want changes grouped by semantic scope so I can review 347 chapter changes as one coherent unit rather than being overwhelmed by individual edits, while still maintaining granular control over each change.

**US-3: Chat Context Traceability**
As a writer using Writerr Chat, I want to see which changes came from specific conversation messages so I can understand the context and reasoning behind each modification.

**US-4: Platform Event Integration**
As a user of the Writerr Platform, I want Track Edits to seamlessly integrate with other plugins through the window.Writerr event bus system, providing real-time change notifications and coordinated workflow management.

**US-5: Enhanced Attribution System**
As a writer processing AI-assisted edits, I want comprehensive metadata about each change including model, processing mode, and timestamp so I can make informed decisions about accepting or rejecting modifications.

## Spec Scope

**Core Integration Features:**
- Editorial Engine API connection for constraint-based processing pipeline
- Platform event bus integration using window.Writerr system
- Context-aware batching algorithm that groups changes by semantic relationships (paragraph/section/chapter scope)
- Enhanced metadata system capturing model, mode, timestamp, and processing context
- Chat message linking for conversation-to-change traceability
- Unified change approval/rejection workflow across all platform plugins

**Technical Implementation:**
- Migration from standalone event system to platform event bus
- Enhanced change detection and attribution algorithms
- Semantic scope analysis for intelligent batching
- Cross-plugin communication protocols
- Metadata persistence and retrieval systems

**User Experience Enhancements:**
- HUD-style integration (silent but available)
- Granular control maintenance with improved batch management
- Context-aware change presentation
- Seamless workflow between Editorial Engine and Chat interfaces

## Out of Scope

- Complete UI redesign (maintain existing interface with platform integration enhancements)
- Performance optimization projects (focus on integration functionality)
- New change detection algorithms (enhance existing detection with platform integration)
- Real-time collaborative editing features
- Advanced undo/redo system beyond current capabilities
- Integration with third-party version control systems

## Expected Deliverable

A fully integrated Track Edits plugin that serves as the change management layer for the Writerr Platform, providing:

1. **Editorial Engine Integration**: Seamless processing of constraint-based edits with full attribution
2. **Context-Aware Change Management**: Intelligent batching and presentation of modifications
3. **Platform Communication**: Event bus integration enabling coordinated plugin workflows
4. **Enhanced User Experience**: Maintained HUD philosophy with improved platform-wide functionality
5. **Comprehensive Attribution**: Full metadata tracking for all AI-assisted changes

The deliverable maintains all existing Track Edits functionality while adding platform integration capabilities that position it as a core component of the professional AI editorial suite.
