## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Function not appearing in Command Palette**:
- ‚úÖ Check `.md` file location in `/AIEditorialFunctions/`
- ‚úÖ Verify YAML frontmatter syntax
- ‚úÖ Ensure required fields (name, description) present
- ‚úÖ Look for validation error notifications

**Poor function results**:
- Review system prompt clarity and specificity
- Check constraint settings are appropriate
- Test with different text types and lengths
- Monitor session learning for drift

**Slow function execution**:
- Reduce `max_suggestions` limit in function definition
- Set `processing_level` to "sentence" instead of "document"
- Enable chunked processing for large documents
- Check AI provider service performance

**Functions not integrating with Track Edits**:
- ‚úÖ Verify `track_edits_integration: true` in function YAML
- ‚úÖ Ensure Track Edits plugin enabled
- ‚úÖ Test with built-in Copy Editor first
- Check AI Providers plugin connection

### Performance Optimization

**Large Document Processing**:
```yaml
# Optimize function for large documents
performance_settings:
  chunk_size: 1000  # words per chunk
  parallel_processing: true
  memory_limit: "500MB"
  timeout: 60  # seconds
```

**Memory Management**:
- Enable automatic cleanup of old suggestions
- Use lazy loading for large function libraries
- Monitor memory usage during batch operations
- Clear function cache periodically

### Quality Control

**Function Validation**:
- Test functions with various document types
- Monitor confidence scores and accuracy
- Review session learning adaptations
- Compare results with manual editing

**Error Handling**:
- Functions fail gracefully with error messages
- Validation prevents malformed suggestions
- Timeout handling for slow AI responses  
- Automatic retry for temporary failures
