# Simplified Editorial Engine Architecture

## Overview

The Editorial Engine has been simplified to focus on reliability and real change generation while preserving all existing integrations and the mode file system.

## Key Changes Made

### ✅ **REMOVED: Complex Components**
- **ConstraintProcessor** - Complex validation logic that created empty changes
- **Complex validation pipeline** - Multi-stage constraint checking that failed
- **Empty change generation** - Root cause of `{from: 0, to: 0, text: ""}` issues

### ✅ **ADDED: Simplified Components**  
- **SimpleDiffProcessor** - Streamlined text processing with real diff generation
- **diff-match-patch integration** - Battle-tested diffing from Google
- **Direct AI→diff pipeline** - Bypasses complex validation for reliability

### ✅ **PRESERVED: Essential Components**
- **RulesetCompiler** - Mode file processing ("waiter" functionality)
- **ModeRegistry** - Mode file loading and management
- **AdapterManager** - Track Edits and other plugin integrations
- **EventBus** - Cross-plugin communication
- **PlatformManager** - API registration system

## Architecture Flow

### Before (Complex)
```
Chat → Editorial Engine → ConstraintProcessor → Complex Validation → Empty Changes → Track Edits
```

### After (Simplified)  
```
Chat → Editorial Engine → SimpleDiffProcessor → [Mode→Ruleset→AI→Diff→Changes] → Track Edits
```

## Technical Details

### SimpleDiffProcessor Workflow
1. **Mode Loading**: Get mode from registry (e.g., "proofreader")
2. **Constraint Compilation**: Use RulesetCompiler to convert mode rules to constraints
3. **AI Integration**: Send original text + constraints for corrections  
4. **Diff Generation**: Compare original vs corrected using diff-match-patch
5. **Change Extraction**: Generate real change objects with proper positions
6. **Adapter Processing**: Send changes to Track Edits adapter for decoration

### Change Object Format (NEW - No more empty changes!)
```typescript
{
  id: "change-123",
  type: "replace", 
  range: { start: 0, end: 1 },
  originalText: "i",
  newText: "I", 
  confidence: 0.95,
  reasoning: "Capitalize sentence beginning",
  source: "simple-diff-processor"
}
```

### Old Problem (FIXED)
```typescript
// OLD: Empty changes that Track Edits couldn't display
{
  from: 0, 
  to: 0, 
  text: ""
}
```

## Compatibility

### ✅ **Full Backward Compatibility**
- **API Interface**: Same `EditorialEngineAPI` methods
- **Mode Files**: Existing `.md` files work unchanged
- **Chat Integration**: `window.Writerr.editorial.process()` unchanged
- **Track Edits**: Adapter system preserved
- **Event System**: All events still emitted

### ✅ **Performance**
- **Build Size**: 144.8kb (same as before - dead code was tree-shaken)
- **Processing**: Faster due to reduced validation overhead
- **Memory**: Lower footprint without complex constraint validation

## Benefits

1. **🎯 Real Changes**: Track Edits now receives actual change objects
2. **⚡ Reliability**: Simpler pipeline with fewer failure points  
3. **🔧 Maintainability**: Cleaner codebase without complex validation
4. **📁 Mode Preservation**: Users keep their custom mode definitions
5. **🔗 Integration Safety**: All existing plugins continue working

## Testing Status

- ✅ **Unit Tests**: Diff engine tested with various correction scenarios
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: End-to-end pipeline verified  
- ✅ **Mode Compatibility**: Existing mode files parsed correctly
- ✅ **Build Tests**: Compiles successfully without constraint processor

## Files Changed

### Modified
- `src/main.ts` - Updated to use SimpleDiffProcessor
- `package.json` - Added diff-match-patch dependency

### Added
- `src/simple-diff-processor.ts` - New simplified processor
- `test-*.js` - Comprehensive test suite

### Removed
- `src/constraint-processor.ts` - Moved to `.bak` (complex validation)

### Preserved
- `src/ruleset-compiler.ts` - Essential mode file processing
- `src/mode-registry.ts` - Mode management  
- `src/adapter-manager.ts` - Plugin integration
- All other core components unchanged
