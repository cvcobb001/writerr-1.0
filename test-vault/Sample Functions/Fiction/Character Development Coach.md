## Usage Examples

### Input Text
```
Sarah walked into the room. She was tall and had brown hair. She was angry about what happened at work. "I can't believe my boss did that," she said. She sat down and looked upset.
```

### Expected Output
```
**Enhanced Character Development:**

Sarah's heels clicked against the hardwood floor, each step echoing her frustration as she entered the living room. At nearly six feet tall, she had to duck slightly under the doorframeâ€”a constant reminder of how she never quite fit into spaces designed for others. Her chestnut hair, usually perfectly styled for client meetings, now hung loose around her shoulders, several strands having escaped during her hurried commute home.

"I can't believe Henderson threw me under the bus like that," she muttered, her voice carrying the controlled fury of someone who'd spent years learning to mask her emotions in corporate boardrooms. She collapsed onto the couch with uncharacteristic gracelessness, her usually impeccable posture crumbling as the weight of the day settled on her shoulders.

**Character Development Suggestions:**

**Physical Details:**
- Add specific, meaningful physical traits that reflect personality or background
- Use physical actions that reveal emotional state
- Consider how physical presence affects interactions with environment

**Voice & Dialogue:**
- Give the character specific speech patterns or vocabulary
- Use dialogue to reveal background, personality, and relationships
- Show character's emotional state through how they speak, not just what they say

**Internal Consistency:**
- Establish character motivations that drive actions
- Create behavioral patterns that feel authentic
- Develop backstory elements that inform present reactions

**Emotional Depth:**
- Show emotions through actions and reactions, not just statements
- Layer multiple emotions (anger + disappointment + fear)
- Connect current emotions to character history or goals
